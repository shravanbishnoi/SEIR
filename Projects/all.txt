<TITLE> SC upholds Mamun's bail </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court on Monday upheld controversial businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun's bail granted by the High Court in a tax evasion case. A five-member Appellate Division bench, headed by justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim, made the order rejecting the government's appeal to overturn the bail order. He will not be released from detention in prison since he faced another case involving money laundering, Sabbir Hamza, lawyer for Mamun told reporters. Mamun got a six-month bail from the High Court in this case on Oct 20. The National Board of Revenue filed the case with Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court on Aug 26 against Mamun for dodging Tk 14 crore in income tax. Additional attorney general A K M Jahirul Haque represented the state while barrister Rafique-ul Huq stood for Mamun. The Appellate Division on Nov 2 upheld Mamun's bail in four extortion cases. On Jan 30, 2007, the joint forces had arrested Mamun, who is known as a close friend and business partner of Tarique Rahman, the son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia.

<TITLE> Ganguly back as Knight Riders captain </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)  Former India captain Sourav Ganguly on Friday returned as the Kolkata Knight Riders' skipper for next year's Indian Premier League, replacing New Zealand's Brendon McCullum, reports PTI. The controversy-ridden IPL outfit, which finished at the bottom of the table this year, also named Dav Whatmore as its new coach with Delhi Ranji coach Vijay Dahiya as his deputy. Pakistani pace legend Wasim Akram was appointed the mentor of the side. "Andrew Leipus and Adrian le Roux have been appointed physiotherapist and team trainer respectively," the team management said in a statement. "The KKR management held several meetings over the past few weeks to discuss and plan the way forward for the franchise and the team. After weeks of careful deliberation, keeping in mind the vision and ideals of the team, the KKR management has appointed Dav Whatmore as the new team coach," the management said, adding Ganguly played an instrumental role in the entire process. "KKR is looking forward to an exciting and successful season ahead with the new appointments and strategies in place. I am excited at the prospect of working with Dav and the entire team closely in addition to playing at our home ground once again," Ganguly said. Insisting that Ganguly's position as captain is not merely ceremonial, the outfit said the former India skipper would be the "key driving force" who would "shape the cricket team" and "would be responsible for all cricket related decisions with regards to the 2010 season." After leading the team in the inaugural IPL, Ganguly fell out with the then coach John Buchanan, who first mooted the "multi-captaincy" idea, which did not find favour with the management. McCullum led the side in the second IPL but came a cropper. Hailing Whatmore's appointment, KKR co-owner Jay Mehta said, "Dav has the right vision not only for the team, but for each of the players, and for the franchise as a whole. He is very aware of our current position in IPL and knows that there is only one way to go now: up." Whatmore, on his part, said he was looking forward to working with Ganguly. "I am optimistic about the season ahead and have the utmost faith in Sourav, the team, and KKR management and look forward to a successful tournament. I will be working closely with the team to continue building KKR into a successful franchise both on and off field," he

<TITLE> India backed Shanti Bahini, Burmese rebels: book </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Subhra Kanti Gupta Kolkata, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)--Indira Gandhi was voted out of power in 1977, just when India's external intelligence organisation, R&AW, was preparing to substantially step up its backing for the Shanti Bahini, says Subir Bhaumik in his just-released book "Troubled Periphery:Crisis of India's Northeast". Bhaumik, a journalist and academic researcher for three decades, has provided graphic details of the R&AW's involvement in the Chittagong Hill Tracts and Burma's Kachin Hills in his latest book. But he makes it clear the "orders came right from the top" and were not operations generated by the agency. "The immediate provocation for the Indian sponsorship of the Shanti Bahini guerrillas .. was the military coup that killed Sheikh Mujibur Rehman and many members of his family. To Indira gandhi, this coup was a political defiance of India . "Within a week of the coup, senior R&AW leaders arrived in Tripura's capital Agartala with a clear brief for their subordinates: Get those Chakma leaders who want to fight Bangladesh." Bhaumik's findings is based on detailed interviews of Shanti Bahini guerrilla commanders and R&AW officials and the book is replete with such references. One Shanti Bahini leader tells Bhaumik about the quality of Indian training. "The Indian training was intensive and tough as the instructors had served with military units in Nagaland and Mizoram. The leadership element of the course was gruelling and involved war games and dummy attacks. "The instructors would observe how we went about the attack and whether we had absorbed the theoretical lessons. They would severely admonish us if we were found lacking. They always reminded us of the maxim that you bleed less in war if you train well in peace." Indira Gandhi's election defeat in 1977 saved Bangladesh, then grappling with mutinies and domestic unrest, from huge trouble, suggests Bhaumik. "Just when the Shanti Bahini were told to prepare for the big push forward and that India would support a strength of 15000 guerrillas came the news of Mrs Gandhi's election debacle and the Congress defeat... "It is not clear how far Mrs Gandhi wanted to go and it is possible that, after the liberation of Bangladesh, she could see the value of a successful foreign campaign could boost her dropping popularity back home. "But her defeat changed the course of events . The R&AW plans to intensify the guerrilla war in Chittagong Hill Tracts were put on hold when Morarji Desai took over as Prime Minister. The R&AW topbrass were categorically told to lay off from CHT." Bhaumik's book says the support to Shanti Bahini was resumed when Mrs Gandhi came back to power--but by then, the Bahini was in the throes of a fratricidal war that led to the assasination of its chief M N Larma. It says that R&AW's Agartala station chief at that time, Parimal Ghosh even resolved this fratricidal conflict by drafting an agreement between the two Shanti Bahini factions. Ghosh in 1971 was close to General (then Major) Ziaur Rahman and operated under his pseudonym Captain Hossain Ali. As a BSF officer, he fought at the Shuvapur bridge with the Mukti Fauj. Bhaumik also details how the R&AW won over the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and started giving them weapons -- just to ensure they would not back any Northeast Indian rebel groups anymore. The man instrumental in this operation was one of the most successful R&AW operatives , B.B.Nandi, who had also served as their station chief in Dhaka. During Nandi's tenure as station chief at Bangkok, he developed close links with the Burmese underground groups, specially the Kachins. Bhaumik says that Nandi even planted a R&AW communications team at the KIA headquarters in the early 1990s, from where they monitored the China-bound movements of the northeast Indian rebels . After retirement, Nandi became a fierce critic of the R&AW and the Indian government when Delhi started befriending Burma's military junta and the BNP-Jamaat combine in Dhaka. Bhaumik's book , published by Sage, details the major issues of conflict in northeast India -- land,language, leadership, ethnicity, ideology , religion -- and offers a policy framework for resolving the crisis. It says the region suffers from severe "democracy and development deficit" and argues that a secular and democratic Bangladesh and a truly federal and democratic Burma is crucial to the stability of India's Northe

<TITLE> House passes sweeping US healthcare overhaul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Nov 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US House of Representatives approved a sweeping healthcare reform bill on Saturday, backing the biggest health policy changes in four decades and handing President Barack Obama a crucial victory. On a narrow 220-215 vote, including the support of one Republican, the House endorsed a bill that would expand coverage to nearly all Americans and bar insurance practices such as refusing to cover people with pre-existing conditions. Most Republicans criticized its $1 trillion price tag, new taxes on the wealthy and what they said was excessive government interference in the private health sector. Democrats cheered and hugged when the 218th vote was recorded, and again when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pounded the gavel and announced the results. The battle over Obama's top domestic priority now moves to the US Senate, where work on its own version has stalled for weeks as Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid searches for an approach that can win the 60 votes he needs. Any differences between the Senate and House bills ultimately will have to be reconciled, and a final bill passed again by both before going to Obama for his signature. "Thanks to the hard work of the House, we are just two steps away from achieving health insurance reform in America. Now the United States Senate must follow suit and pass its version of the legislation," Obama said in a statement after the vote. "I am absolutely confident it will, and I look forward to signing comprehensive health insurance reform into law by the end of the year," he said. The overhaul would spark the biggest changes in the $2.5 trillion US healthcare system, which accounts for one sixth of the US economy, since the creation of the Medicare government health program for the elderly in 1965. ABORTION DEAL The vote followed days of heavy lobbying of undecided Democrats by Obama, his top aides and House leaders. The narrow victory was clinched early on Saturday by a deal designed to mollify about 40 Democratic opponents of abortion rights. Democrats had a cushion of 40 of their 258 House members they could lose and still pass the bill. In the end, 39 Democrats sided with Republicans against it. The lone Republican to vote in favor of it was first-term Representative Anh Cao of Louisiana. "It was a bipartisan vote," Democratic leader Steny Hoyer said to laughter among fellow Democrats afterward. The landmark vote was a huge step for Obama, who has staked much of his political capital on the healthcare battle. A loss in the House would have ended the fight, impaired the rest of his legislative agenda and left Democrats vulnerable to big losses in next year's congressional elections. Obama traveled to Capitol Hill on Saturday morning to meet with House Democrats and emphasize the vital need for the healthcare reform bill. Republicans and Democrats battled in sometimes testy debate through the day and into the night on Saturday over the bill, which would require individuals to have insurance and all but the smallest employers to offer health coverage to workers. It would set up exchanges where people could choose to purchase private plans or a government-run insurance option bitterly opposed by the insurance industry, and it would offer subsidies to help low-income Americans buy insurance. Congressional budget analysts say the bill would extend coverage to 36 million uninsured people living in the United States, covering about 96 percent of the population, and would reduce the budget deficit by about $100 billion over 10 years. "We can't afford this bill," said Republican Representative Roy Blunt. "It's a 2,000-page road map to a government takeover of healthcare." REPUBLICAN PLAN REJECTED Democrats rejected on a 258-176 vote the much smaller Republican healthcare plan, which focused on cost controls and curbing medical malpractice lawsuits but did not include many of the insurance reforms of the Democratic plan. The House also approved on a 240-194 vote an amendment that would impose tighter restrictions on using federal funds to pay for abortions. House Democratic leaders agreed to allow a vote on the amendment to mollify about 40 moderate House Democrats who threatened to oppose the overhaul without changes to ensure federal subsidies in the bill for insurance purchases were not used on abortion. The move enraged Democratic abortions rights supporters, but they largely voted in favor of the bill in hopes they can remove the language later in the legislative proc

<TITLE> Djokovic to face Federer after survival act </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BASEL, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number one Roger Federer survived a difficult first set before beating unseeded compatriot Marco Chiudinelli to reach the final of his hometown Swiss Indoors on Saturday. He will face third-ranked Novak Djokovic, who pulled off an even more impressive survival act by saving three match points before beating Radek Stepanek 6-7, 7-5, 6-2. Federer, facing an opponent who has rocketed up more than 800 places up the world rankings in the last year to 73rd, saved a set point in the first set tiebreak before going on to win 7-6, 6-3 against the Swiss number three. With Chiudinelli serving for the set, Federer produced a stunning crosscourt backhand pass and followed that up with an ace. Chiudinelli then blasted a forehand out to give Federer the set. The rank outsider had more than held his own during the first set when he also had three break points in the eighth game. Having missed his chances, the second set went to script as Federer brushed aside his less illustrious countryman to move within one match of his fourth successive title in Basel. "It's a very emotional tournament for me," said Federer, who was once a ball boy at the event. "It's one of the priorities where I try to stay fit." "You have to be very focussed on this surface," added Federer, who took a six-week break beforehand. "I think I'm ready for a difficult match." RELIEVED DJOKOVIC Djokovic was a relieved man after battling against his own serving problems. "I served quite badly throughout the match and on this surface its crucial to serve well," Djokovic told reporters. "It was a very difficult match." Neither player managed a break in the first set and in the ensuing tiebreak Czech Stepanek went 5-2 up. Although Djokovic managed to pull two points back, he then produced two unforced errors to hand Stepanek the set. The second set also went with serve until the dramatic 10th game when Stepanek held a 40-0 lead and three match points after some erratic serving from the Serb. Djokovic regained his composure and managed to save all three to hold serve, then broke his opponent in the following game with a crosscourt pass. "That game was terrible for me," said Djokovic. "I just tried to get some first serves in and managed to do it." The Serb produced another break at the start of the third set as the clearly shaken Stepanek, who had dominated much of the match, lost his n

<TITLE> Workers' strike paralyses river communication </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  River transport workers enforced an indefinite strike from Saturday midnight to realise their 22-point demands disrupting movement of vessels across the country. No vessel left the Sadarghat terminal in the morning, stranding hundreds of passengers. The demands include a proper pay scale, effective application of riverine laws and stopping harassment and robbery on river routes. Bangladesh River Transport Workers Federation began the strike from Saturday midnight, taking in passenger, goods and fishing vessels. bdnews24.com correspondent Kamal Hossain reported there was no launch leaving Dhaka's main Sadarghat terminal as passengers intending to travel turned up. The launches bound for nearby destinations like Chandpur generally leave the terminal in the morning while those on the distant routes set out in the afternoon. Amena Begum, a passenger, told bdnews24.com she had come to the terminal to travel to Chandpur. "But there is no launch going there," she said. Another passenger Shahina Akhter had to return home when she failed to get any transport. Mahbubur Rahman, police sub-inspector at the capital's main Sadarghat terminal, told bdnews24.com no vessels had left the terminal since Sunday morning. Motor launch MV Reaz's employee Asgar Hossain said they would continue their strike until their demands were met. Shah Alam, senior vice president of the workers federation, earlier told bdnews24.com that the strike had begun "as scheduled" at midnight after overnight launches had left the terminal. "It will continue until our demands are met," he said. Alam said they were forced to call the strike as they did not get any hint for a solution to their problems even after setting a 15-day deadline on Oct 21. Alam said they had talked to shipping minister Shahjahan Khan, river vessel owners and others concerned people for meeting their demands. "They all assured us of a solution, but a solution is yet to come," he added. Since there was no sign of progress, the river workers were forced to set a 15-day deadline on Oct 21, he said. BIWTA director Shafiqul Haque told bdnews24.com: "Talks have taken place more than once, but there is no development yet in resolving the problems." He said he did not see any possibility that the workers would call off their strike soon. bdnews24.

<TITLE> Market attack in NW Pakistan kills at least 8 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PESHAWAR, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed an anti-Taliban village mayor and seven other people in an attack on the outskirts of Pakistan's volatile city of Peshawar on Sunday, officials said. The bomber blew himself up as Abdul Malik, mayor of Matni village, was standing in a busy market. Matni is close to the lawless tribal lands where Islamist militants are active. "So far, eight people have died, including Abdul Malik," Sahibzada Anis, Peshawar's top administration official, told Reuters. Hospital officials said at least nine people were killed and 36 wounded, several of them seriously. Islamist militants have unleashed a campaign of bomb and suicide attacks in Pakistan in recent weeks in retaliation for a major offensive launched by security forces in their main bastion, South Waziristan, on the Afghan border. That assault in South Waziristan's rugged landscape of barren mountains and hidden ravines, now a centre of global Islamist militancy, is being closely watched by the United States and other powers embroiled in Afghanistan. To support their overall anti-militant drive, Pakistani authorities have encouraged Pashtun tribes to revive traditional militia to counter rising Islamist militancy. 'DEADLY AGAINST TALIBAN' Malik was head of a lashkar, or tribal militia, raised by the villagers against the militants. "He was pro-government and was deadly against the Taliban," Peshawar police chief Liaquat Ali Khan said. Militants have killed numerous pro-government tribal elders over the past few years, and have stepped up attacks recently. Last month, more than 100 people were killed in a car bombing in Peshawar in the deadliest attack in the country in two years. More than 150 people were killed in attacks before the army began the assault in South Waziristan. The army went on the offensive in the ethnic Pashtun region on Oct. 17 aiming to root out Pakistani Taliban militants behind a wave of violence in urban areas. Soldiers have been advancing into the militant heartland from three directions and had entered their headquarters of Makeen on Frid

<TITLE> Mushtaq was worst traitor: attorney general </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com) - Attorney general Mahbubey Alam termed late president Khandaker Mushtaq Ahmed a "killer" and "the worst betrayer", during the Bangabandhu murder appeals hearing on Sunday. Mushtaq succeeded 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as president after the assassination of the nation's founding father and most of his family members by a group of army officers on Aug 15, 1975 . As president, Mushtaq promulgated the Indemnity Ordinance in September 1975, granting impunity to those involved in the killings. "The killers of August 15, 1975 were the followers of Khandaker Mushtaq. They executed plan to kill Bangabandhu. No army mutiny took place that day," Alam told the Supreme Court on Sunday. The five-member Appellate Division bench, headed by justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam, began hearing the arguments of the attorney general on the 25th day of the appeals proceedings. Arguing against the defence plea of an 'army mutiny', Alam said: "The Aug 15 killing in no way can be termed mutiny. Even the convicts in their statements did not say it was a mutiny." "Mushtaq was the legal guardian at the weddings of Sheikh Jamal and Sheikh Kamal (sons of Sheikh Mujib, married when he was detained by Pakistan forces)." "What a betrayal! "He killed Bangabandhu with renegade army soldiers. If that is termed mutiny the very definition of 'mutiny' should be changed. "It was not a mutiny, it was a conspiracy to kill Bangabandhu along with his family members. "The killers went to Bangabandhu's house like thieves... and left the house like jackals after killing him. Alam said: "If it was a mutiny the killers would have gone to the homes of the vice president (Syed Nazrul Islam), the speaker (Abdul Malek Ukil), the army chief KM Shafiullah and chief of general staff Khaled Mosharraf. "It was a blueprint to destroy Bangabandhu. That's why they killed his family members. Quoting the observation of the third High Court judge in the Bangabandhu murder trial verdict, the attorney general said: "From all evidence and unfolding of the events it is clear that no force including the army breached chain of command that day. No incident of mutiny did take place that day." "It is irrelevant to mention army mutiny in such a stage of the case since none of the 61 witnesses termed it so. "They never said that it was a mutiny. Even in the death reference hearing in the High Court the mutiny was not mentioned. "The defence lawyers are raising questions about the authority of the trial by contending that it was indeed a mutiny in the appeals hearing. On whether the legality of the trial of the court can be questioned at this stage of the proceedings, Alam said: "The Supreme Court has specific direction on the matter. Convict Syed Faruk Rahman previously questioned the legality of the relocation of the court regarding the case. "But the defence never before raised questioned the authority of the trial of the court. "They never said that it was a mutiny and the trial could not take place in the regular court. Quoting from Faruk Rahman's statement, Alam said: "Faruk Rahman said the Aug 15 event was not an army uprising." At the start of the hearing an emotional Alam said: "I cannot control my tears while reading the paper-book of the Bangabandhu murder case. This is a historic case. All papers such as First Information Report, chargesheet, witnesses' account, the verdicts of the trial court and the High Court and the ruling on leaves to appeal are furnished in the paper-book. "The best Bangalee for thousand of years was killed along with his family members on Aug 15, 1975. Bangabandhu was just 58 years old at that time," sais Alam. "In his short time Bangabandhu united and awakened the Bengalees. He was the pioneer of the Bengalee nationalism. The secularism was introduced that time." He broke into tears. The court asked Alam to present his arguments on the main contents instead of being emotional. The attorney general said: "The killers not only killed Bangabandhu they also killed the modern democratic spirit." Alam said: "This was a heinous killing. The trial of the case is yet to end, though 34 years are over." He asked the court whether it was beyond the public. "The responsibility of the judicial court is to deliver equal justice to all. This also represents the image of the court," he said. Drawing the attention of the court to barrister Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, a lawyer of the state panel, Alam said: "Barrister Taposh is the son of Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni. He wants the trial for the killing of his parents and grandfather. "He (Taposh) has been awaiting the trial for years on end." Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni, the nephew of Bangabandhu, was also killed on Aug 15, 1975. Mentioning convict Aziz Pasha, Alam said: "Aziz Pasha killed Begum (Fazilatunnesa) Mujib. Sheikh Russel (youngest son of Bangbandhu) wanted to go to his mother. "He was taken upstairs and killed there. There is no limits to such cruel killing. The killers are beyond all values." Sheikh Kamal and Sheikh Jamal were freedom fighters, Alam said. "If Kamal's wife were alive she could have turn out a great sports person of the country. It was by chance that Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana were abroad at that time. That's why they survived." Alam quoted the chief state counsel in the case, late Sirajul Haque, as saying . "I don't want the trial of Bangabandhu as the president and my friend. I want trial for the killing of Mujib as an individual." "I am saying today Sirajul Haque is no more. But there are people who are still crying. Sheikh Taposh wants the trial of his parents and grandfather." The trial of the case is taking too long, Alam said. "The hearing of the case took place for 155 days, 66 days at the dual High Court bench and 25 days at the third High Court bench. "It took 26 days for hearing the leave to appeal. The appeals hearing in the Supreme Court is running for 25 days. "Even though the trial has been running for so long, the defence says they are not being given sufficient time." Alam said: "The defence is talking about about court martial. "If the trial were held under military law the convicts would not have got such opportunities," he said. Before Alam, the chief state counsel in the case, Anisul Haque, delivered his arguments. The prosecution started its arguments on Nov 2. On Oct 5, the newly formed bench began hearing the appeals against previous court sentences to hang some convicts in the case for assassinating the nation's founding leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. Its progress has depended upon the political dispensation in power. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. Then, Sheikh Mujib's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convictsMajor (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmedappealed to the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000, the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice A B M Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all the 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four appealed against their sentence in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, retired Lt Col (lancer) A K M Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former Lt Col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. The detained death convicts are dismissed Lt Col Syed Faruk Rahman, retired Lt Col Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, retired Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), retired Major Bazlul Huda and retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin (lancer).

<TITLE> Ponting compares 'special' win to World Cup </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  Ricky Ponting has said that his inexperienced and under-strength side's victory in India was among the best one-day successes he has been part of, including the Champions Trophy and the World Cup wins, reports Cricinfo. Australia clinched the seven-match series after winning the sixth ODI in Guwahati by six wickets, a result that gave them a 4-2 lead with one game in hand. "It's probably one of the best one-day series I have ever been involved in, what with all the injuries and setbacks at the start of this tour," Ponting said. "We have won a lot of series here in India but this one will be up there with some of the specials that I played in, including our Champions Trophy and World Cup wins. For the boys to stick together as a group and play as team of 11 players for the last few games has been very satisfying. "India is a hard place to come and win and this victory means a lot, especially when you haven't got all your players to pick from. It makes it even harder when players are getting off planes and turning up and playing. No one's shirking and no one's whining, we have just got on with it and tried to do the best that we could." Australia's campaign in India was ravaged by injury even before it started with four first-choice players - Nathan Bracken, Michael Clarke, Brad Haddin and Callum Ferguson - unavailable for selection. Their troubles grew more severe during the tour as Brett Lee, James Hopes, Tim Paine, Peter Siddle and Moises Henriques also picked up injuries and had to be flown home. Before the fifth ODI in Hyderabad, Australia had only 13 fit players to choose a XI from and Ponting said the way they responded to adversity was heartening for the future. "With each game that we have played, we have just gotten better and better so it's really good signs for the team," he said. "Some of the younger guys have come into the team and have got a few games under their belt. They have been building experience towards the World Cup in 2011 and I think they will have learnt a lot from this tour." The victory in Guwahati was Australia's third consecutive win in the series, following successes in Mohali and Hyderabad. Fast bowler Doug Bollinger, who took his second five-for in ODIs, and Mitchell Johnson reduced India to 27 for 5, effectively ending the contest in the first hour. "The bowlers obviously led the way today, Johnson and Bollinger were outstanding upfront. The way they started after second ball of the day went for six was really remarkable," Ponting said. "He [Bollinger] bowled brilliantly, starting from his first game back in Delhi. To get five wickets on a pitch which did not offer much to the fast bowlers is a terrific reward. Once we got those four or five wickets we were always in control of the game." Ponting also praised Australia's fielding, which he felt made the difference during the close finishes in Vadodara and Hyderabad. "We talk about it a lot around our team and pride ourselves on the way we field. Quite often in close games it's the fielding which is the difference between the teams. We've had a four-run win [in Vadodara] and a three-run win [in Hyderabad] in this series and some of the great fielding that we have had in this series has gone a long way in helping us

<TITLE> Indonesia quake kills at least one, homes collapse </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JAKARTA, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A strong earthquake struck Indonesia's Sumbawa island early on Monday morning, killing at least one person and injuring around 80 after damaging homes, schools and mosques, a police official said. The U.S. Geological Survey said the epicentre of the 6.7-magnitude quake was 15 km (10 miles) north-northwest of Raba, Sumbawa, at a depth of 18 km (11 miles). There was no tsunami warning issued after the quake, which struck at 3:41 a.m. local time (1941 GMT Sunday). Tjatur Aprianto, the police chief in Bima, a town in Sumbawa near the epicentre, said six people had been badly injured with three in a coma and one who later died. The official said 72 people had suffered minor injuries, while authorities were still compiling damage estimates. "Residential houses, school buildings, mosques have been damaged, but not all of the buildings are totally destroyed, part of them have collapsed," said Aprianto. An official from Indonesia's meteorology agency earlier told Reuters there had been reports of panic in Mataram, the capital of the nearby island of Lombok, where a strong tremor was felt. Lombok, east of Bali, is popular with local and foreign tourists, while Sumbawa is mountainous and relies more on agriculture. Indonesia is situated in an area of intense seismic activity known as the "Pacific Ring of Fire". More than 1,000 people died after a powerful earthquake hit the city of Padang in West Sumatra in September. Separately, a landslide in Palopo in South Sulawesi killed 8 people, while five others were missing, said Rustam Pakaya of the Indonesian health ministry's disaster agency.

<TITLE> We're not looking too far ahead: Dhoni </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)  India are a loss away from just their third bilateral one-day series defeat since 2006, but MS Dhoni was not letting the pressure get to him. India surrendered a 3-2 series lead in Hyderabad, where they fell three runs short of a target of 351, to arrive in Guwahati needing to win to prevent their first bilateral series defeat since Australia toured two years ago, reports Cricinfo. "It [the Hyderabad loss] was hurting and disappointing. But we have left everything in the dressing room," said Dhoni. "We have two more games to go and that's what count now. Whatever has happened has happened. You cannot change much about it. It's important to concentrate on what lies ahead and stay fresh mentally. "Every game was a pressure game in the series and the remaining two games also. Our first priority is to be in the series, so we have to win the next game and not looking too far ahead." India's middle order has not produced a lot of runs over the last two matches and that was a major factor in their current series position. As he most always does, Dhoni patted back criticism of two bad outings from the middle order, himself included. "We rely on a good start but every now and then your openers don't score and the pressure comes to the middle order," said Dhoni. "This is one of the series where the middle order has not performed consistently. "It's not a worrying thing. But of course it's good if we get a good start so that the middle order and lower order capitalise on that." The young all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja has bowled decently in the series as support to Harbhajan Singh but has not done much with bat, prompting questions of his viability in the side. Yet without an alternative allrounder option in the squad Dhoni backed Jadeja to perform. "He is doing well but when it comes to selection, we don't speak too much about it," he said. "But every individual, if he is doing well he deserves a chance to be in the side. Jadeja is bowling well, as series goes he will turn up more as a bats

<TITLE> Russia must keep promise to supply missiles: Iran </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Nov 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia should keep its word on selling a missile defense system to Iran, an influential parliamentarian was quoted by Iranian media as saying Sunday. Moscow, which is under Western pressure to distance itself from Tehran, has not followed through on proposals to supply high-grade S300 air defense missiles to the Islamic state. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised Russia last month for failing to provide the arms to Iran, which is at odds with the West over its nuclear and missile program. Washington has sought specific pledges from Russia for tougher sanctions against Iran over its nuclear energy program, which the West suspects is intended to produce nuclear weapons. Tehran denies any such intention. "If Russia does not keep its promises to deliver the missiles, then it would be a negative point in our relations," Alaeddin Boroujerdi, head of parliament's foreign policy and national security committee, said in comments carried by official news agency ISNA. "Avoiding delivery of S300 defense system to Iran, if that is Russia's official stance, would be a new chapter in breaking promises by the Russians." Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov said last month "there have been no such deliveries to date." The truck-mounted S-300PMU1, known in the West as the SA-20, can shoot down cruise missiles and aircraft. It can fire at targets up to 150 km (90 miles) away and travel at more than two km per second. Israel, which is thought to have the Middle East's only atomic arsenal, has hinted it could attack Iran in an effort to stop its arch enemy obtaining nuclear weapons. Iran has threatened to retaliate for any attack by firing medium-range missiles at Isr

<TITLE> Dhaka, Thimphu ink trade deal, talk climate </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka and Thimphu renewed a bilateral trade deal and discussed climate change on Saturday, during Sheikh Hasina's visit to the Himalayan kingdom. Bhutanese prime minister Jigmi Y Thinley thanked his Bangladesh counterpart for highlighting the impact of climate change on countries like Bhutan, alongside Bangladesh, in the global arena. "We are grateful to you for your noble efforts in raising the issue prominently in important international forums," Thinley told Hasina at a meeting on the second day of her visit. Briefing the press, following the meeting, the prime minister's deputy press secretary Nazrul Islam said the two premiers discussed a range of socio-economic issues and strengthening of ties in important areas including trade and connectivity. Officials, touring with the prime minister, told bdnews24.com that the two premiers also agreed on increasing road connectivity between the two South Asian countries for further expansion of bilateral trade. Foreign minister Dipu Moni had said ahead of the visit that Bangladesh and Bhutan would broach the subject of transit through India, but were not expected to sign a deal just yet. She said the two countries would renew a trade agreement, however. The agreement was renewed between the two sides on Saturday. Bangladesh's commerce minister Faruque Khan and his Bhutanese counterpart Lyonpo Khandu Wangchuk signed the agreement on behalf of their respective countries. Bhutanese foreign minister Lyonpo Ugyen Tshering and minister for economic affairs of Bhutan Lyonpo Khandu Wangchuk were with the Bhutanese side while Bangladesh foreign minister Dipu Moni, industries minister Dilip Barua and prime minister's adviser HT Imam accompanied Hasina during the meeting. Hasina said renewal of the agreement would further expedite bilateral trade and commerce between the two countries benefiting both. Hasina eyes power from Bhutan Hasina also expressed interest in importing electricity from the Himalayan nation during her visit. Bhutanese press focused on the power issue on Hasina's arrival in capital Thimphu Friday. Bhutan's English-language daily Kuensel asked: "Will Bhutan be able to export electricity to Bangladesh in the future?" "If Bhutan can export electricity we will be very happy to get it," Kuensel quoted Hasina as telling the Bhutanese press. Foreign minister Dipu Moni had told bdnews24.com, before their departure, that Bangladesh wanted to "become involved" with production of electricity in Bhutan, an energy surplus country. The tiny mountainous kingdom has the potential to produce up to 30,000 MW of hydro electric power, according to estimates of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. Indian companies have so far been able to extract 10,000 MW from the country, most of which goes to India, experts say. If Bangladesh and Bhutan reach an agreement on power, however, they must get Indian approval to implement it. The two countries would have to construct distribution lines across 50 kilometres of Indian territory for export of electricity from Bhutan. Audience with the king Hasina was given a royal welcome for her audience with King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck at his Tashichodzong office on Saturday morning. Hasina's motorcade was led by a colourful Chipdrel procession, with flutes, trumpets, drums and Bhutanese dancers in traditional dress, to the South Gate of the Tashichhodzong. Here, Sheikh Hasina and the Bangladesh delegation were received by Thimphu governor Lhab Dorji and senior government officials. The national anthems of Bangladesh and Bhutan were sung, as Hasina received a guard of honour and salute from the Bhutanese Royal Army. Hasina, in her later meeting with her Bhutanese counterpart, thanked his government and the people for her warm reception in the city of Thimphu. He accepted the invitation, saying he would visit Bangladesh at a convenient time. She handed over medicines to her Bhutanese counterpart as part of Bangladesh's offer of emergency drugs worth Tk 20 lakh for victims of the country's recent earthquake. bdn

 Dhaka, Nov 09 (bdnews24.com)-- Prime minister Sheikh Hasina returned from her four-day visit to Bhutan on Monday. Her flight landed at Zia International Airport at 01:15pm, where she was greeted by high officials including the finance minister, agriculture minister, LGRD minister and chiefs of the armed forces. Hasina expressed interest in importing electricity from the Himalayan nation when she saw Bhutan's King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck on Saturday at Tashichodzong in Thimpu. She also met with Bhutanese prime minister Jigmi Y Thinley the same day. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, accompanying Hasina to Bhutan, told bdnews24.com on Thursday, before their departure, that Bangladesh wanted to "become involved" with production of electricity in Bhutan, an energy surplus country. The tiny mountainous kingdom has the potential to produce up to 30,000 MW of hydro-electricity, according to estimates of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Indian companies have so far been able to extract 10,000 MW from the country, most of which goes to India, experts say. If Bangladesh and Bhutan reach an agreement on power, they must get Indian approval to make it successful. The two countries would have to construct distribution lines across 50 kilometres of Indian territory for export of electricity from Bhutan. Hasina also told the Bhutanese press after landing at Paro International Airport, "We want to enhance and develop the existing trade and business between two countries as Bhutan is a good neighbour of Bangladesh." Bangladesh's exports to Bhutan is less than $1 million, and includes warm garments, computer accessories, dry food, pharmaceuticals, toiletries and textile items. Bhutan's exports to Bangladesh totals around $14 million, according to the latter's commerce ministry figures. Bhutan's main export items are mineral products, foodstuffs, fruits, beverages and oat. Hasina, Dipu Moni, industries minister Dilip Barua, commerce minister Faruque Khan, and others of a 28-member delegation landed in the Bhutanese capital Friday on a three-day official visit. bd

<TITLE> Haye shocks Valuev in WBA heavyweight title bout </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NUREMBERG, Germany, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Briton David Haye clinched the WBA world heavyweight title with a points win over holder Nikolai Valuev of Russia on Saturday. Haye, who became Britain's first heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis retired six years ago, scored 116-112 points on the scorecards of two judges, the third giving it a 114-114 tie in the bout dubbed "David versus Goliath." "This means everything to me. Since I was a little baby, I wanted to be heavyweight champion of the world," Haye said in a ringside interview. "It's amazing. I dreamt of this, now it's reality, it's real... he wasn't hitting me so as long as you are not getting hit you are okay. "I hit his head early in the fight but it was the hardest thing I've ever hit, it was like hitting a brick wall... I'm pretty sure I've broken my hand. I made him look like an amateur. People doubted my skills... but I did enough to win," Haye said. Valuev, the tallest and heaviest world champion of all time who has yet to be floored in his 16-year professional career having lost only one bout, struggled throughout the 12-round bout against a speedier opponent who is also lighter by 44 kilos. Former world cruiserweight champion Haye, who took a 22-1 record into the bout with the 'Beast from the East', is also almost a foot shorter than his seven foot (2.13 metres) opponent but he made up for it in speed and accuracy. DAMAGED RIGHT "I damaged my hand early on in the second or third round so I couldn't throw too many right hands, so I had to win it with my left hand. I had to take my foot off the gas and win it clever," said Haye. "I'm having it large tonight. I've disciplined myself so much over the last six months. I was gutted when the fight earlier in the year fell through (against IBF, IBO and WBO champion Vladimir Klitschko), but this makes up for everything." The 29-year-old Londoner landed a handful of big left-right combinations in the early rounds that troubled the towering Russian who could not pin the quick Haye to the ropes. Valuev failed to connect, landing almost no damaging blows, as he struggled to cope with Haye's pace. "The speed of my opponent was a problem," said Valuev. "I could not work my right, and the 40-plus kilos difference in weight is something you start to feel." Haye even landed a massive left hook 60 seconds before the end of the final round, rattling the 36-year-old and threatening him with his first knockout. The Russian managed to stay on his feet but knew too well the title was lost. "It was all decided in that final round," Valuev said, whose record now is 50-2. "It was clearly that last round."

<TITLE> UN's Goldstone criticizes US reaction to Gaza report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Nov 8,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The head of a UN investigation that accused Israel of war crimes in Gaza, Richard Goldstone, has said he is disappointed there has been such a "lukewarm" reaction to his findings in the United States. The report by Goldstone, a South African jurist, lambasted both sides in the December-January war, which killed up to 1,387 Palestinians and 13 Israelis, but was harsher toward Israel. It gave Israel and Palestinian Hamas militants six months to mount credible investigations or face possible prosecution in The Hague. Both Israel and Hamas denied committing war crimes. "The reactions in the international community were very mixed, but the lukewarm from the United States disappointed me," Goldstone told das Parlament, a weekly political newspaper published by Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag. "The fact that the reactions from Israel were so violent really surprised me at times," he added, according to the German text of his comments published on Sunday. "I had that hoped our call to take legal steps and pursue people at a national level would fall on more open ears." Israel has criticized the report as unbalanced and says the 47-nation Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council, which commissioned the report, is biased against the Jewish state. The 71-year-old Goldstone, who led a commission of inquiry into political violence and police hit squad activities in the early 1990s in his homeland, is himself Jewish. A UNHRC resolution last month censured Israel for its actions in the Gaza war without referring to any wrongdoing by Hamas. The United States voted against it. President Barack Obama is under pressure to restart stalled peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis. Critics accuse his administration of failing to halt the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, a step seen by many as a precondition for peace negotiati

<TITLE> El Salvador death toll jumps to 124: Funes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SAN SALVADOR, Nov 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The death toll from flooding and mudslides in El Salvador triggered by the passage of Hurricane Ida jumped to 124 people, Salvadoran President Mauricio Funes said in a national radio broadcast. Funes described the disaster as "a tragedy" and said the damage sustained by the Central American country was "incalculable." Authorities have declared a state of emergency in five regions, Interior Minister Humberto Centeno said. Reported BBC. Mr Centeno said the capital San Salvador and central San Vicente province were the hardest-hit regions. Journalist Juan Carlos Barahona told the BBC that San Vicente had almost been completely cut off by landslides and collapsed bridges. Mr Barahona, of the El Salvador daily La Prensa Grafica, told the BBC that the other worst affected areas were La Libertad, La Paz and Cuscatlan. Mr Centeno said 60 people were still missing, and about 7,000 more were in shelters. " The weather continues to be bad... We are worried things will get worse if the rains continue " Verapaz's police officer In the town of San Vicente rescue workers pulled bodies from the wreckage of houses. "We rescued a man this morning who had fractures, and a little girl," resident Cristian Aguilar told Reuters news agency. "My son and I crossed through the floodwater and brought them here, and now she is with her parents." The rains also triggered massive rock slides from the Chichontepec volcano that buried several houses in the town of Verapaz, also in San Vicente province, officials said. A local police officer told the Associated Press: "The weather continues to be bad, and we already have a river flowing through the village due to a landslide. We are worried things will get worse if the rains continue." News of the deaths came as Hurricane Ida, which has now strengthened to a category two storm, was poised to enter the Gulf of Mexico. However, Ida, which passed to the east of El Salvador three days ago, is not thought to have directly caused the severe rains. The BBC's weather centre said El Salvador's rains were mainly caused by a separate low pressure system in the Pac

<TITLE> HC withholds ruling on MF rights shares </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)The High Court withheld on Sunday a verdict given the same day, which allows mutual funds to issue rights and bonus shares, for seven days. The move was made after pleas from lawyers defending the Securities and Exchange Commission that barred mutual funds issuing rights and bonus shares through an amendment. The verdict, however, had said that the ruling would be applicable only on the mutual funds that were listed when the amendment was done on July 22, 2008 by the SEC, said M Zahir, the counsel for the petitioners. "The High Court ruling also gave SEC the power to approve the issuance of right or bonus shares," he told reporters at the HC premises. SEC's lawyer Mahmudul Islam asked for the halt as they would appeal against the verdict, added Zahir. Mutual fund operators cited the verdict as "appropriate". "There's really nothing to be excited about the verdict," Md Iftikhar-uz-zaman, chief executive of ICB Capital Management told bdnews24.com. He however, said that mutual funds should have a provision to issue rights share or bonus shares. "The verdict is appropriate." Iftikhar said close-end mutual funds cannot issue stock dividends by definition. "Close-end mutual funds by definition can only increase its paid-up capital through revised redemption," he added. On July 22, 2007, the SEC amended the rule regarding mutual funds where it prohibited mutual funds to increase its paid up capital through issuing rights shares. The decision also barred mutual fund operators to issue bonus shares as dividend. An SEC spokesperson then told the press that the move was to remove the ambiguities in the rule. "There are some ambiguities in the rule about mutual funds," said SEC executive director Farhad Ahmed. The news of restrictions, just two days before the closing of accounts of mutual funds angered retail investors, followed by demonstrations by them and a slump in the prices of MFs. Consequently the market slipped into the red due to sell-offs as investor confidence on the market went down. bd

<TITLE> Karzai says he's addressing corruption </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai said in an interview airing Monday he is taking steps to root out corruption in his government, but he also said foreign money was making the problem worse. In addition to what he called "the usual corruption in any government," Karzai said he is dealing with a kind of corruption that is foreign to his country. "We also mean corruption of a different kind which is a lot more serious, which is new to Afghanistan, which is with the arrival of a lot of money to Afghanistan," Karzai said in an interview with the PBS program "The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer." Without providing specific examples, Karzai listed contractual mechanisms, a lack of transparency in awarding contracts and corruption in implementing projects among the "new" and more serious corruption problem. "The stigma falls mainly on Afghanistan because that's where it happens, and that's why we should address it first and also hopefully that our partners in the international community will also recognize problems on their side and try to correct them with us," he said in the interview taped for broadcast on Monday. Washington has long called for a stronger and more accountable Afghan government to fight a Taliban insurgency which is at its deadliest since the Islamists were forced from power in 2001. Since being re-elected in a controversial poll in which a fraud investigation rejected more than a million of his votes, Karzai has been under intense pressure from his Western backers to introduce swift anti-corruption reforms. U.S. President Barack Obama, who is considering whether to send an additional 40,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan, and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown are pressing Karzai to act decisively to fight corruption. Karzai said in the interview he already was addressing corruption in his government. "Where we have found facts on corrupt practices by senior government officials, we have acted, they have gone to prison," he said. He urged his allies to respect Afghanistan's judicial system, but also backed a statement by his Foreign Ministry, calling on them to respect his country's sovereignty. "We like our partners to have a lot of respect for Afghan sovereignty. Afghanistan is extremely sensitive about that," Karzai said. "We must all be very careful while we are partners with one another, while we work together, while we are traveling this journey together that our partnership and our advice is a friendly one and with good intentions and not one that can be interpreted any other way," Karzai added. On his relationship with Washington, Karzai suggested both countries needed to become better educated about the other. "In the cultural environment that both of us work in, we have to respect the American cultural sensitivities," Karzai said. "And the Americans must respect the Afghan cultural sensitivities, in which we have a lot of that, by the w

 Rajshahi, Nov 09 (bdnews24.com)  Two students were killed and at least 30 injured Monday as a study tour bus from Rajshahi Polytechnique Institute crashed into a roadside ditch trying to evade hijackers in Naogaon. The dead identified as third year students Imtiaz Hossain Razu, 20, of Godagari upazila, and Zeenat Rehana Moly, 20, of Rajshahi city. The institute's principal Dr Jainal Abedin told bdnews24.com that two buses were carrying students to Barapukuria Coalmine in Dinajpur on a study tour. "At around 3.30 in the morning, at Solpi bridge in Dhamoirhat upazila, on the Dhamoirhat-Jaypurhat highway, the buses came across trees placed across the road by a group of hijackers." "The bus drivers tried to evade the hijackers. That's when one of the buses lost control, veered off the road and crashed into a roadside ditch," said Abedin. Two students were killed on the spot, he said. Dhamoirhat police sub-inspector Rezaul Islam Reza said the bus driver, reaching Solpi bridge, had tried to take a U-turn at high speed after seeing the suspected hijackers on the bridge. Five injured students were admitted to Rajshahi Medical College hospital in critical condition, and over 20 others were admitted to Dhamoirhat Upazila Health Complex, said rescue workers.

<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)Kushtia police recovered eight "large bombs" in the Islamic University locality near the district town on Saturday. Two members of a faction of the outlawed militant outfit Gono Bahini were arrested with the bombs, Kushtia police assistant superintendent (headquarters) Alamgir Hossain told bdnews24.com. The two were identified as Moyen Uddin, 38, and Imdadul Haque, 43. "The bombs were found in a plastic bag in Moyen's possession," said Hossain. "We were tipped off that members of the banned extremist outfit were meeting secretly at a banana plantation in the Santidanga 14 Mile area," said the police official. Detective Branch police went to the spot at around 11.45pm to round up the suspects, said Hossain. "Seven or eight of them managed to escape before police could arrest Moyen and Imdadul." Hossain said the bombs recovered were "much larger in size than handmade 'cocktail bombs'." "They have been soaked in water to deactivate them," he said. Bomb experts were inspecting them, he added. Police are interrogating Moyen and Imdadul for further information. "We suspect they were planning some major attack," said Hossain. Law enforcers have expressed concern in recent months at the rising incidence of extremist activities in the southwest, attempting a serious crack down in the region, Kushtia in particular. Less than a week ago, Kushtia police arrested local Mahila Awami League leader Taslima Khanam Akhi with an AK-47 assault rifle. The AL leader and three associates were arrested from a vehicle on the outskirts of the district town on Nov 3, in possession of the AK-47, a shotgun and 82 rounds of ammunition. Police said all four were found to have links to Gono Mukti Fouz, another left-leaning militant outfit banned by the government. Akhi was expelled from the ruling party's women's wing the following day for "violating party discipline and for links to criminal activities". Meanwhile, the law and order crack down in the southwest has led to a spate of so-called 'crossfire' killings in recent months. Some 27 suspected militants have been killed over the past three months in Kushtia alone in reported shootouts with law enforcers.

<TITLE> Imran's untold story revealed by scribe </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com) -- The "untold" story of Pakistan cricket icon Imran Khan has finally been revealed by an Indian journalist, who has come up with unknown details about the sportsman-turned-politician, reports PTI. Khan's cricketing glory fascinated Frank Huzur, a young boy from Bihar capital Patna, to such an extent that by the time he completed his studies and started his career as a journalist, the fascination turned into a passion for the former Pakistan skipper. "Imran was not only a superstar of the cricketing world but also a celebrity. He was very positive and very affirmative. I could never come across a cricketer who had an independent opinion on the state of world affairs," Huzur, who has finished Khan's authorised biography "Imran versus Imran -- An Untold Story", said. The book is Huzur's tribute not only to Imran's politics of "struggle and sacrifice" but also to Pakistani society and people, he said. The Indian journalist travelled to Pakistan several times and visited Lahore, Islamabad and Mianwali in search of credible information about Imran. The former cricketer is as much popular across the world as Congress party scions Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, Huzur said. Rahul has said he likes Imran's political style, which has been quite surprising to many people in India, as has been Imran's endorsement of Rahul's efforts at grassroots politics, he said. Speaking about the relationship between India and Pakistan, Huzur said that the major problems affecting the two neighbours are illiteracy and ignorance, and more needs to be done by the two governments. "There have been efforts to defuse tension between the two at individual and non-government levels. Cultural and literary exchanges do have a role in enhancing people-to-people contacts but both governments should increase the frequency of meetings and visits of bureaucrats, both civil and military," he suggested. The 550-page book to be published in London, is likely to come out during next spring. Imran Khan played for Pakistan from 1971 to 1992 and served as its captain throughout 1982-1992. He led his team to World Cup victory in 1992. In 1996, Khan founded the Tehreek-e-Insaf party, and represented Mianwali as a member of the National Assembly from November 2002 to October

 BENONI, South Africa, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa were forced to toil hard ahead of their limited overs series against England Sunday before overcoming Zimbabwe by 45 runs in a one-day international. Zimbabwe, chasing 296 for victory, were reduced to 48 for five after South Africa had reached 295 for five from their 50 overs. Tatenda Taibu (103 not out) and Stuart Matsikenyeri (86) then added 188 off 193 balls in a record sixth wicket partnership against South Africa. The previous record of 124 was set by Craig McMillan and Chris Harris for New Zealand in Adelaide in the 1997/98 season. Taibu's second century in 111 one-day internationals came in the final over of the innings as he took Zimbabwe to 250 for six. He struck six fours and three sixes off 112 deliveries.

<TITLE> Man City draw again as Burnley strike late </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester City had to settle for a fifth consecutive Premier League draw on Saturday, finishing 3-3 with Burnley after having battled back from a two-goal deficit to lead with three minutes remaining. Tottenham Hotspur took advantage to move back into the top four above City with a 2-0 home defeat of Sunderland after two consecutive losses while Aston Villa climbed to fifth with a 5-1 hammering of Bolton Wanderers at Villa Park. Portsmouth remain bottom of the table after losing 3-1 at fellow strugglers Blackburn Rovers. City looked to have sealed the points when goals from Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kolo Toure and Craig Bellamy wiped out Burnley's 2-0 lead but Kevin McDonald struck late to earn the visitors their first away point this season. "It's fair to say we were disappointed with our first half performance," City manager Mark Hughes, who spent nearly 100 million pounds in pre-season, told Sky Sports. "We put in a huge effort to get our noses in front and we should have seen the game out. There are things we need to look and things we need to address." City, who last won a league game in September, fell to sixth on 20 points, Villa have 21 while Tottenham are on 22, the same as Arsenal who can leapfrog Manchester United into second spot if they win at Wolverhampton Wanderers later. Sunderland could count themselves unlucky to lose at Tottenham, dominating the game for long periods. Robbie Keane gave Tottenham and early lead but were hanging on to that slender advantage when their former striker Darren Bent was brought down by goalkeeper Huerelho Gomes to earn a penalty, only to have it saved by the Brazilian who was fortunate to still be on the pitch. Sunderland manager Steve Bruce bemoaned his side's luck. "Anybody who witnessed that today will know that we should have got something," he told Sky. "We were terrific. "In my opinion Gomes should have been sent off because he denied a clear goalscoring opportunity. That was the turning point. We missed the penalty and they should be down to 10." Tom Huddlestone wrapped up the points when he blasted a shot past Sunderland's substitute keeper Marton Fulop, one of five former Tottenham players in action for the visitors.

 WASHINGTON, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US House of Representatives approved a sweeping healthcare overhaul on Saturday, backing the biggest health policy changes in four decades and handing President Barack Obama a crucial victory. On a narrow 220-215 vote, the House endorsed a bill that would expand coverage to millions of the uninsured and bar insurance practices such as refusing to cover people with pre-existing conditions. The battle over Obama's top domestic priority now moves to the US Senate, which is working on its own version.

<TITLE> Obama, Netanyahu to meet as US peace effort flounders </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Nov 9,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Barack Obama was due to hold talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington on Monday amid floundering US efforts to jump-start stalled Middle East peace talks. The meeting between the two leaders is likely to anger Palestinians, who are already frustrated by what they perceive as backsliding by the Obama administration on the contentious issue of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. An Obama administration official said the president would meet Netanyahu, in Washington to address a forum of North American Jewish leaders, but offered no details about what they would discuss. There had been doubts about whether Obama would even meet Netanyahu until Sunday afternoon, when the US official confirmed Israeli media reports. Aides to Netanyahu said the two leaders would discuss the peace process and the nuclear stand-off with Iran. Despite the Obama administration giving high priority to restarting peace talks and dispatching envoys to the region, prospects for a meeting between the Israelis and Palestinians soon have grown ever fainter. Obama's drive to revive the peace process faced a setback last week. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, a pivotal partner in any negotiations, accused Washington of retreating from its demand for a freeze on settlements and threatened not to stand in elections in January. Such a move could force a postponement in peace talks for months to come. Obama has eased U.S. pressure on Israel over settlements, calling for restraint in construction where he had earlier pushed for a freeze. Palestinians say that shift in policy has killed any hope of reviving negotiations soon. SETTLEMENTS AN OBSTACLE Netanyahu has rebuffed Obama's call for an immediate halt to construction of settlements and said it should not be a precondition to restarting peace talks. The settlement issue is a major obstacle in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and has opened the most serious rift in Israel's relations with the United States in a decade. Washington says it still wants a freeze on settlement building but that it need not be a precondition for talks, as Abbas, a moderate supported by the West, is demanding. "We are ready to talk and the Palestinians aren't. It's as simple as that," Netanyahu told reporters traveling with him to Washington on Sunday. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton faced strong Arab criticism over the US stance on the settlement issue during a visit to the region last week. She insisted Washington still wanted a freeze on settlement construction but believed that resuming peace talks was the best way to curb them. A US official said the push for talks was aimed in part at seeing what Netanyahu envisioned when he offered to negotiate immediately. Thus far most of the pressure had been on Abbas to agree to talks, the official said. Netanyahu will likely address the issue when he speaks at the forum of Jewish leaders in Washington on Monday. Obama was also due to speak there, on Tuesday, but canceled his appearance in order to attend a memorial service for soldiers killed in a mass shooting at a US military base last w

<TITLE> Rampant Arsenal go second, Man City draw again </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal romped to a 4-1 victory at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday to move into second place in the Premier League while Manchester City's hopes of threatening the top four were hit by a fifth consecutive draw. City drew 3-3 with Burnley after having battled back from a two-goal deficit to lead with three minutes remaining. Tottenham Hotspur moved back into the top four, above City, with a 2-0 home defeat of Sunderland after two consecutive losses while Aston Villa climbed to fifth with a 5-1 hammering of Bolton Wanderers at Villa Park. Portsmouth remain bottom of the table after losing 3-1 at fellow strugglers Blackburn Rovers. Arsenal took their goal tally to 36 in 11 league games with captain Cesc Fabregas again magnificent for the Gunners as he scored his ninth goal of the season. Arsenal's first two goals were scored by Wolves players. "Overall it was a good performance," Wenger told the BBC. "They made a strong start -- but once we got ahead, we controlled it. "Our belief is there, we want to give our best in every game. We have great potential and we can go from strength to strength." Wolves, who dropped into the bottom three, started well but own goals by Ronald Zubar and Jody Craddock scuppered any hopes of a first win over Arsenal since 1979. Fabregas finished off a flowing move to make the second half academic and Andrei Arshavin rifled in a shot to make it 4-0 before Craddock scored a late consolation. Manchester City looked to have sealed the points when goals from Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kolo Toure and Craig Bellamy wiped out Burnley's 2-0 lead but Kevin McDonald struck late to earn the visitors their first away point this season. "It's fair to say we were disappointed with our first half performance," City manager Mark Hughes, who spent nearly 100 million pounds in pre-season, told Sky Sports.

<TITLE> Hurricane Ida aims for Gulf of Mexico oil fields </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SAN SALVADOR Nov 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hurricane Ida roared through the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday, where important oil fields are located, after triggering floods and mudslides that killed 124 people in El Salvador. Ida was expected to weaken gradually on Monday as it heads toward some of the oil and gas production facilities in the central Gulf, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. The storm reached hurricane force again late on Saturday and strengthened to a Category 2 storm on Sunday with sustained winds of near 105 mph, the Miami-based hurricane center said in its 10 p.m. EST (0300 GMT) advisory. Some energy companies in the Gulf of Mexico were evacuating workers from offshore platforms and several large producers shut down some oil and gas production as a precautionary measure. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, the only terminal in the United States capable of handling the largest tankers, said it would stop unloading ships due to stormy seas. A quarter of U.S. oil and 15 percent of its natural gas are produced from fields in the Gulf and the coast is home to 40 percent of the nation's refining capacity. In El Salvador, rivers burst their banks and hillsides collapsed under relentless rains triggered by Ida's passage, cutting off parts of the mountainous interior from the rest of the country. El Salvador's government said 124 people were killed as mudslides and floods swept away rudimentary houses. The bulk of the Central American country's coffee is grown in areas far from the worst affects of the flooding but the national coffee association had no estimate of potential damage to the harvest. The hurricane center set a hurricane warning from Pascagoula, Mississippi, to Indian Pass, Florida, meaning hurricane conditions could be expected in the area within 24 hours. A tropical storm warning was in effect for parts of Louisiana and Mississippi including the city of New Orleans, which is still recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. LOUISIANA PREPARES Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency on Sunday, allowing the government to mobilize troops and rescue workers. If Ida makes landfall in Louisiana it would be the first storm to strike the state since Hurricane Gustav came ashore in September 2008. As of 10 p.m. EST (0300 GMT), Ida was 400 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River and was moving north-northwest near 14 mph, the hurricane center said. Ida was expected to turn toward the north and move faster toward the Gulf Coast before veering off to the northeast late on Monday. Ida swept past the Mexican resort of Cancun on Sunday, doing little damage to the city. About 1,000 people were evacuated from Mexico's Holbox Island, an isolated fishing community and sanctuary for thousands of flamingos and other exotic birds located northwest of Cancun. Ida first became a hurricane on Thursday off the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua, where heavy rains forced more than 5,000 people into shelters. The country's coffee crop was not directly affected by the storm, according to the local coffee coun

<TITLE> Hasina eyes power from Bhutan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 07 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, on a visit to Bhutan, has expressed interest in importing electricity from the Himalayan nation. Hasina saw Bhutan's King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck Saturday at Tashichodzong in Thimpu. Hasina was also scheduled to meet Bhutanese prime minister Jigmi Y Thinley Saturday. "Will Bhutan be able to export electricity to Bangladesh in the future?" Bhutan's English-language daily Kuensel asked on its online site. "If Bhutan can export electricity we will be very happy to get it," Kuensel quoted Hasina as saying to the Bhutanese press. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, accompanying Hasina to Bhutan, told bdnews24.com Thursday, before their departure, that Bangladesh wanted to "become involved" with production of electricity in Bhutan, an energy surplus country. The tiny mountainous kingdom has the potential to produce up to 30,000 MW of hydro electric power, according to estimates of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Indian companies have so far been able to extract 10,000 MW from the country, most of which goes to India, experts say. If Bangladesh and Bhutan reach an agreement on power, they must get Indian approval to make it successful. The two countries would have to construct distribution lines across 50 kilometres of Indian territory for export of electricity from Bhutan. Hasina also told the Bhutanese press after landing at Paro International Airport, "We want to enhance and develop the existing trade and business between two countries as Bhutan is a good neighbour of Bangladesh." Bangladesh's exports to Bhutan is less than $1 million, and includes warm garments, computer accessories, dry food, pharmaceuticals, toiletries and textile items. Bhutan's exports to Bangladesh totals around $14 million, according to the latter's commerce ministry figures. Bhutan's main export items are mineral products, foodstuffs, fruits, beverages and oat. Hasina, Dipu Moni, industries minister Dilip Barua, commerce minister Faruque Khan, and others of a 28-member delegation landed in the Bhutanese capital Friday on a three-day official visit.

<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)Talks between river transport workers and the shipping ministry failed on Sunday afternoon. The workers vowed to continue their indefinite strike on passenger, goods and fishing vessels, which began Saturday midnight paralysing river communications from morning. The Bangladesh River Transport Workers Federation, a coalition of worker unions, enforced the strike to press their 22-point demands, including a proper pay scale, effective application of riverine laws and a stop to harassment and robbery on river routes. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at Sadarghat since Sunday morning, finding no launches leaving the capital's main river terminal, while goods piled up too. Launches bound for nearby destinations like Chandpur generally leave in the morning while those on the distant routes set out in the afternoon. Huge crowds scrambled to get a place on one of the few vessels leaving the terminal, the government-run 'Rocket' steamer that left for Khulna at 6pm. Thousands of other passengers were seen waiting through the day, expecting withdrawal of the strike. Motor launch MV Reaz's employee Asgar Hossain said they would not call off the strike until their demands were met. In Chittagong, port officials said unloading of ships at the outer-anchorage had been halted as lighter ships were not operating during the strike. Joint secretary of the Bangladesh River Transport Workers Federation Khorshed Alam told bdnews24.com, "No lighter ship has offloaded goods from the mother vessels since morning." Port authorities said some 48 ships have been waiting to unload. bdnews

<TEXT>
 MADRID, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A row has broken out between Real Madrid and the Portuguese Football Federation over whether injured forward Cristiano Ronaldo should be called up for the two-legged World Cup playoff against Bosnia. The first leg is in Lisbon on Nov 14 and the second in Zenica four days later and federation chief Gilberto Madail said on Thursday that Ronaldo wanted to play and would be joining up with the squad. Real have said their world record signing needs two more weeks of treatment on his ankle and director general Jorge Valdano said on Friday Ronaldo would not be going. "The doctors and common sense prevent Cristiano Ronaldo being called up by Portugal," he told Spanish radio. Real coach Manuel Pellegrini said he understood Portugal's desire to call up the forward but added that in his opinion both Ronaldo and the federation knew that he would not be able to play. "If he were able to we would have already used him," he told a news conference on Friday. "Understandably the player is worried. I am sorry for him and for Portugal." Ronaldo was hurt in a Champions League match against Olympique Marseille on Sept 30 and has not played since aggravating the problem in Portugal's 3-0 win over Hungary 10 days later. He was due to return to action around now but Real said on Thursday tests conducted by a specialist in Amsterdam who treated the same ankle last year had confirmed the diagnosis of the club's medical staff. Ronaldo said on his way back from the Netherlands on Thursday that the ankle was getting better and that he hoped to be fit for the Bosnia playoff. "We have to wait and see and take things a step at a time but it seems to be improving," he was quoted as saying in Friday's edition of sports daily M

<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com) -- The void created by the retirement of spin legend Shane Warne can never be filled in the Australian team, feels chief selector Andrew Hilditch, reports PTI. Hilditch, who was recently reappointed Australia's chief selector until the 2011 World Cup, created quite a stir here by trying at least seven spinners since Warne retired after the Ashes series in 2006-2007. "The reality is when we lost Warne, it couldn't have come at a worse time. Moving forward I think we have made a lot of progress. We will never replace Warne, that is a non-existent possibility. There is always going to be a hole and to some extent we've got to stop talking about it," Hilditch said. Australia have tried Stuart MacGill, Beau Casson, Cameron White, Jason Krejza, Brad Hogg, Nathan Hauritz and Bryce McGain in the last few years but are yet to find a permanent replacement for Warne. Hilditch said he was happy with Hauritz's performance and feels the off-spinner has the calibre to go far. "Hauritz has made really good progress. We are really happy with how he is going. We think we have found someone who can play a role for us in international cricket, so that's great," Hilditch was quoted as saying in Herald Sun. "I am feeling a lot better about spin than if you had asked me 12 months ago when we were really looking at stop-gap measures to rebuild our spin stocks," he

<TITLE> Iraq passes election law paving way for January poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi lawmakers passed a long-delayed election law on Sunday to pave the way for a January poll, after parliament sidestepped a potentially explosive row over the oil-producing city of Kirkuk. Prolonged wrangling over the law had thrown the election date into doubt, and US officials had feared the row would hit plans to draw down US troops next year. "Tough challenges remain and I am sure there will be difficult days to come but this agreement advances the political progress that can bring lasting peace and unity to Iraq, and allow for an orderly and responsible transition of American combat troops out of Iraq by next September," US President Barack Obama said. The parliamentary election is seen as a crucial test for the world's 11th largest crude oil producer as it emerges from carnage unleashed by the US invasion in 2003. After weeks of deadlock, a compromise over the conduct of the poll in Kirkuk was approved by 141 out of 196 lawmakers, in a rowdy session broadcast live on state television. Kurds consider Kirkuk their ancient capital, want to make it part of their northern region and sought to use up-to-date voter rolls to reflect an increase since 2003 in their numbers there. Arabs and Turkmen say the city should remain under central government authority and believe Kurds have stacked Kirkuk to tip the demographic balance. The law ended up using current voter registrations but made the election result subject to a review if there was an unusual increase in registered voters in the last five years. The consequences of a possible review were left ambiguous. 'THE WHOLE TRICK' The actual date of the election will be decided by Iraq's electoral commission, which said it would not be on January 16, as originally scheduled. "We will work even during our holidays," said the head of the commission, Faraj al-Haidari, vowing to prepare swiftly. The legislation allows for the vote to be held between January 16 and 31. U.S. Ambassador Chris Hill said he expected it to be on January 23. Analysts said lawmakers had done nothing to resolve the longer-term status of Kirkuk, whose crude fields contain about 13 percent of Iraq's proven oil reserves. "The Kirkuk situation is still on hold. It's like a bomb waiting to be activated. There's no agreement at all on that," said political analyst Hazim al-Nuaimi. Kirkuk is one of several flashpoints that could lead to clashes between Baghdad's Arab-led government and Kurds who have enjoyed a large degree of independence since the 1991 Gulf War. US officials, fearful Kurd-Arab tensions might be the seed of Iraq's next war, said they welcomed parliament's solution. "The whole trick was to make people understand that this election, these election rules, these voter rules, cannot be used to try to get a leg up in the Kirkuk negotiations," said US envoy Hill. "So we tried to very clearly fence it off." Lawmakers began the Sunday session by voting article-by-article, but quickly moved to pass the entire bill once the sticky issue of Kirkuk reared its head. The poll law also gave voters the right to choose individual candidates -- known as an open list system -- as opposed to the legislation in the previous national election that only allowed the electorate to choose a party. Political analysts say the open list system is likely to benefit Shi'ite Muslim Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who will seek credit from voters for Iraq's fall in violence. "Being able to hold the elections on time ... is a victory of the will of the Iraqi people and a hard response to the terrorists and former regime members who want to unsettle security and blow up the political process," Maliki s

The team will begin their campaign with a three-day game against Board President's XI starting on Nov 11 in Mumbai, from where they will move on to Ahmedabad for the first Test starting from Nov 16. Kanpur (Nov 24- 28) and Mumbai (Dec 2- 6) will host the second and third Tests respectively. Both the teams have played each other 29 times in Test matches with India having won 11 matches, while the visitors have won only five. The remaining 13 matches have ended in draws. Interestingly, none of Sri Lanka's five wins have come in India though the visiting team has played 14 matches in the country. India beat Sri Lanka 2-0 the last time these two teams met in the country in a three-match series in 2005-06. After the Test series, Sri Lanka will play two Twenty20 Internationals -- Nagpur (Dec 9) and Mohali (Dec 12) -- and five one-dayers at Rajkot (Dec 15), Visakhapatnam (Dec 18), Cuttack (Dec 21), Kolkata (Dec 24) and Delhi (Dec 27).

<TITLE> Muslims watching US with guarded optimism: OIC chief </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISTANBUL, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Muslim world is watching how the United States will act on the stalled process for Palestinian-Israeli peace and wondering how one of the main sticking points, Israeli settlements, will be resolved, the world's top diplomat for Islam said on Saturday. Arab discontent over statements from Washington seen as favouring Israel culminated this week when Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he did not want to run in an upcoming poll, citing disappointment with US President Barack Obama. Abbas' frustration with Obama centred on the US administration backing away from support for demands for a "freeze" on Israel settlement building in the occupied West Bank and an endorsement of Israel's view that settlement expansion should not be a bar to resuming peace talks. "We would like to keep our hopes that President Obama's commitments and good intentions will translate to reality, but of course we've found that the whole negotiation comes back to square one," said Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, secretary general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC). "The sine qua non for any negotiation is the stopping of the settlements ... We are still hopeful despite the fact that there are more reasons not to be hopeful," he told Reuters. The 57-nation OIC, based in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, was set up in the early 1970s when Islamic nations were divided along Cold War lines. While the body has no direct political power it represents more than one billion Muslims. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to halt construction in the settlements, many of which the Jewish state plans to annex under any eventual peace accord. Palestinian elections are scheduled for Jan. 24, though few are anxious to take on Abbas' role, throwing into doubt the reconciliation of fighting Palestinian factions as well as the peace process with Israel. Ihsanoglu, a Turkish history professor who became OIC secretary general in 2005, spoke ahead of an economic summit that has drawn criticism from human rights organisations for hosting Sudan President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who is facing an international arrest warrant for war crimes. Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, Syria's President Bashar al-Assad and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad are also expected to arrive to Istanbul on Sunday for the summit, which is expected to focus on boosting economic alliances among OIC member countries. The one-day summit's guest list has added to concerns that European Union candidate Turkey, an important regional ally of Washington, is shifting away from its pro-Western foreign policy, while distancing itself from traditional ally Israel. Ihsanoglu rejected claims predominantly Muslim Turkey with was drifting away from its western allies. "I don't see Turkey's strengthening its relations with its neighbours or the OIC countries at large as a substitute for its relations with other countries, including European countries, or the West," said Ihsanog

<TITLE> 'Graft can be cut by changing work method' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dinajpur, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)--The Anticorruption Commission chairman believes graft can reduced to a great extent by changing the way the administrative work is run. "The issue of corruption is complicated. It cannot be easily done away with," Golam Rahman said at a discussion titled 'Administrative steps to resist corruption' in Dinajpur on Monday. Rahman said influential, corrupt people are slipping through the legal loopholes, but declared that no compromise would be made about the corrupt people. The ACC chief believes the efforts to usher in the digital era in Bangladesh would cut corruption. He urged everyone to be committed to resist corruption for the economic development.

<TITLE> `Call of Duty' game shoots to make history </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Forget the buzz over the next "Twilight" film or James Cameron's "Avatar." The biggest entertainment hit of the holiday season may come on Tuesday, when "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2" hits stores. The video game published by Activision Blizzard Inc is the most highly anticipated of the year, winning accolades from gaming blogs and Wall Street analysts alike. But it also arrives at a time when the weak economy is punishing sales across the video game industry. Activision has plenty riding on the launch, and much to lose if the game falls short of expectations. Shares of the company have risen around 30 percent this year, outperforming chief rival Electronic Arts Inc's 18 percent gain. "This is the one game that could buck the economic trend for the holiday season," said MKM Partners analyst Eric Handler. He estimates the title will account for 16 cents of Activision's earnings per share in the December quarter, and more than one-third of the publisher's bottom line. Analysts say "Call of Duty's" audience of hard-core gamers, generally young men, are likely to hit stores in droves to pick up the $60 game. Activision is partnering with 12 retailers including GameStop Corp and Best Buy Co for more than 10,000 midnight store openings in North America. Sales estimates range from 11 million-13 million units by end-2009, which would put the game in rarefied company. Activision said preorders set a record. The shooter game is likely to be "one of the largest entertainment launches of any media of all time," CEO Robert Kotick said this week. MKM's Handler expects "Call of Duty" to sell close to 5 million units on the first day, and 7 million-8 million in the first week. That would beat last year's blockbuster "Grand Theft Auto IV" from Take-Two Interactive Software Inc, which sold 3.6 million units on the first day, and 6 million in its first week or more than $500 million in sales. MILITARY GAME The new game is the sixth installment in the "Call of Duty" franchise, which was launched in 2003. It boasts stunning cinematography, with gamers portraying elite soldiers hunting down targets in South America, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan. Players navigate through modern scenarios, ranging from shooting while racing on life-like snow mobiles, or stealthily moving through arid locales, hunting down enemy snipers and avoiding helicopters overhead. "Call of Duty" carries a rating of "M," meaning the content is suitable for those age 17 and older. Some critics point fingers at the video game industry for often graphic depictions of bloodshed -- especially after sensational acts of public violence. But while the "Grand Theft Auto" series has been criticized by some for glorifying crime, "Call of Duty" has not been similarly condemned. Next week's release comes at an awkward time. On Thursday, 13 people were killed and 30 wounded in a mass shooting at Fort Hood in Texas, the biggest military facility in the world. An army psychiatrist trained to treat war wounded is suspected as the gunman. When asked if the shooting would affect the launch, Activision said it was still moving forward and there was nothing to suggest a connection between the Fort Hood incident and video games. MIDNIGHT OPENING Despite the economy, U.S. video game software sales are expected to grow to $19.5 billion in 2013 from $14.7 billion in 2008, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. That makes it a bigger entertainment ticket than Hollywood's $9.6 billion in 2008, according to industry website boxofficemojo.com. Much like a summer blockbuster movie, shooter games like "Call of Duty" tend to have a massive crush of sales in the first few days as eager gamers flood stores to get their copy. "By all indicators, we anticipate 'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2' will be the biggest entertainment launch of 2009, as well as the biggest video game launch in GameStop's history," said Tony Bartel, executive vice president of merchandising and marketing for GameStop. The video game retailer will open 4,200 outlets on Monday night, some as early as 9 p.m. Some stores will feature promotional appearances by celebrities and athletes. Other popular games this year, such as Nintendo Co Ltd's "Wii Fit" or the "The Beatles: Rock Band" from Viacom Inc's MTV, have appealed to more casual gamers and include women and older people in their target demographic. The new "Call of Duty" has scared off Activision's competition, some analysts say. "A lot of publishers and developers have pushed their titles up either well before the release or to after the holidays, and what that does is just add to 'Call of Duty's' success," said EEDAR research group analyst Jesse Divni

<TITLE> China's Wen seeks to boost blossoming Africa ties </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao meets African leaders on Sunday, aiming to boost a relationship which politically goes back decades and is now economically booming -- to the discomfort of some in the West. All eyes will be on new offers of aid to Africa at the meeting in Egypt, after President Hu Jintao promised $5 billion in loans and credit at the last summit in Beijing in 2006. Blossoming trade and business ties have drawn Western criticism that Beijing is only interested in African resources, while Chinese commentators retort that envious Europeans still treat the continent like a colony. Wen himself underlined the strength of the relationship. "Despite the great distance between China and Africa, the friendship between our two peoples has remained strong," he told a business forum in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh before the main meeting. Chinese officials have been coy about exactly how much more Wen may offer. But a draft action plan, details of which were obtained by Reuters, showed China will "China has all along had an interest in Africa's development, and genuinely wants to build homes for Africans and make a contribution towards improving livelihoods," Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming wrote in the state-run International Business Daily this week. China's friendship with Africa dates back to the 1950s, when Beijing backed liberation movements in the continent fighting to throw off colonial rule. Trade has jumped in the past decade, driven by Chinese hunger for resources to power its economic boom and African demand for cheap Chinese products. Still, this has not been without its critics, who say China is only interested in African resources and supports governments with dubious human rights records as a means to get them. Such criticism makes China angry, and draws rebukes that the West still views Africa as though it were a colony. "The West is envious of China and Africa drawing closer," popular Chinese tabloid the Global Times, published by Communist Party mouthpiece the People's Daily, wrote on Tuesday. "Europeans view Africa as their own backyard," the newspaper quoted Chinese Africa expert Xu Weizhong as saying. "Of course they feel uncomfortable about the arrival of the Chinese." Some Africans welcome how China's approach differs from that of Europe or the United States. "China's policy is based on mutual development. Few Western countries have a foreign policy like this -- most are about telling Africans what to do," said Kwaku Atuahene-Gima, executive director of the Africa programme at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. China says it is up to Africans to decide whether the relationship is good for them, and is sure they will say it is. "Practice proves that the China-Africa relationship is mutually beneficial, and cooperation is win-win, embodying the wishes of the people and the demands of the times," minister Chen wro

<TITLE> BATEXPO spot orders down 30pc </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com) -- Spot orders from buyers at this year's BATEXPO, the country's largest apparel fair, fell 30 percent from last year, according to the industry's top trade body. Spot orders at last year's expo amounted to $55.45 million; this year they totalled just $41.64 million, BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedi told a press briefing Sunday. On the reason behind the fall in orders, he said buyers are seeking lower prices. "Buyers say prices are much lower in other countries," said Murshedi. He said production costs had risen at home due to gas and power crises, mismanagement at Chittagong port and high rates of interest as well as bank charges. Exports of readymade garments in the first quarter of the current fiscal dropped by 9.71 percent compared to the same period last year, he added. "Exports for the month of September fell by 26.93 percent from the same month last year." Meanwhile, the government has set export targets for woven and knitted garments at $17.6 billion this year, which is 13 percent above last year's target. Fearing further fall in exports in October, Murshedy told reporters the crisis can be averted if the government comes up with "policy support". The three-day BATEXPO 2009, of the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturer and Exporters Association, ended on Saturday. According to BGMEA, 62 organisations hosted 86 stalls for buyers from UK, US, Canada, Middle East, Hong Kong and Japan. bd

<TITLE> Capello issues World Cup warning to England players </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Established England regulars like centre-back Rio Ferdinand and goalkeeper David James will not go to the World Cup finals next year unless they have been playing regularly and are fit, England coach Fabio Capello has said. The Italian, who will name his squad later on Sunday for next Saturday's friendly against Brazil in Doha, said the rule applied to every player including Manchester United's Ferdinand, who he described as one of the best centre-backs in the world. Both Ferdinand and James have missed matches recently because of injuries and unlike England coaches of the past, Capello said he would not consider taking anyone with an injury that might even heal during the month-long competition. "The players that will be with us in South Africa will be all fit," Capello said. "If you go to South Africa and try to recover there, it will be no good. "It will not be warm which makes it easier to recover. It will be cold in South Africa for the World Cup. "It's impossible to wait for a player. Little injuries, okay, but anyone suffering bigger problems, they will not be there. "Rio is absolutely one of the best centre-backs in the world. As a player I have no worries about him. But he needs to be really fit and playing every game. "Right now he has some problems with his back and he has to train more." Former England manager Sven Goran Eriksson included David Beckham in the 2002 squad and Wayne Rooney in 2006 when both were recovering from broken bones in their feet, but Capello will not tolerate the same leniency next year. NO KING For that reason, Tottenham Hotspur captain Ledley King, who is battling a long-term knee injury and only trains once a week, will not go to the World Cup and a doubt remains over James, England's first choice goalkeeper. "We have spoken about King and it is impossible for him to come with us," Capello said. "He trains only on a Friday to play on a Saturday. "We are following David James. He's playing well but his problem is he can't train two days running. It's a problem we have to decide, but we have time. "But I am not worried about the goalkeepers, we have Robert Green, we have Ben Foster, but James has a problem." Capello added that next week's match against Brazil will act as a good barometer as he begins to fine-tune his preparations for the finals. "The match will be important for us to understand where we are. We will be against players who are at a really high level. "They will pose the sort of problems we will have to face at the World Cup." Not surprisingly, he ranked Brazil as one of the favourites in South Africa. "When they started their qualification they had some problems but step by step they have improved. "They are strong, defending well and really dangerous with their forwards and their movement without the ball. They play like a team now, not waiting for a stroke of genius from one player ...and it will be a great test for

<TITLE> Pakistan's nuclear weapons are safe, for now </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's nuclear installations are so well guarded that Islamist militants behind a wave of violence in the country's heartland would find it very hard to storm them and steal material for a nuclear bomb, analysts say. But the sophistication of recent attacks and their proximity to Pakistan's nuclear infrastructure suggest this risk, while low, remains a cause for worry. "I don't think it is realistic any more to say there is no threat to these weapons, that they are totally safe," said Professor Shaun Gregory at Britain's University of Bradford. Heavy conventional guarding, a blanket of secrecy, deliberate deception, the separation of warheads from missiles, and security practices adopted from the United States are all used to protect weapons and nuclear installations. The nightmare scenario would be of militants using a suicide bombing as a diversionary tactic in order to send in a team of commandos -- similar to those who attacked the Pakistan Army's own headquarters last month in the city of Rawalpindi. Then, and given the secrecy surrounding Pakistan's nuclear program this would need collusion and information from inside, they would try to grab fissile material for a nuclear bomb. "If commandos managed to penetrate a nuclear installation, that would be a very serious breach," said Sharon Squassoni, at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. "It's likely they would fail, it's very likely they would fail, but that would be a bit too close for comfort." It is a scenario the army, which guards its nuclear assets as its best defense against Pakistan's bigger neighbor India, will do everything in its power to avoid. "If the Pakistan Army does one thing, it will be to ensure the nuclear assets stay with them," said Rahul Roy-Chaudhury at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. "These are the key strategic assets of the Pakistan Army. This is what prevents India from attacking them, in their view." Indeed so well guarded are the nuclear weapons that in the event of war, no outside power could take them out. "The Americans, the Indians, the Israelis do not have any chance of spiriting these weapons away except with the help of the Pakistan Army," said Gregory. PERSONNEL VETTING The military has also long been aware of the need to keep Islamist militant sympathizers away from the nuclear weapons program -- a concern frequently cited given close links in the past between the army and various militant groups. General Khalid Kidwai, head of the army's Strategic Plans Division which runs the nuclear program, conducts intensive personnel vetting modeled on U.S. personality profiling. "He is very much in control of things," said Roy-Chaudhury. "I believe he runs a strong counter-intelligence program. Anyone employed is closely vetted; senior officers are selected personally by him." According to analysts and research reports, the warheads are not mated with aircraft and missile delivery systems. Nor are they moved except in times of crisis -- as happened in 1999 and 2001/2002 during confrontations with India. Other security measures cited by analysts, but hard to confirm, include the separation of warheads from detonators. They also say the army is believed to have developed a rudimentary system to electronically lock its nuclear weapons, modeled on the US Permissive Action Link (PAL). Nonetheless, the ability of Islamist militants, some linked to al Qaeda, to strike apparently at will in Pakistan's heartland Punjab province, give pause for thought. Both Rawalpindi and Islamabad, respectively the military and political capitals, have come under attack in recent weeks. EVOLVING TACTICS Last month's attack at army headquarters in Rawalpindi demonstrated a sophistication in tactics which could be developed further for an assault on a nuclear installation. The gunmen, wearing army uniform, were able to break through a security gate, and take hostages. The raid, and the drive-by fatal shooting in Islamabad of a brigadier on leave from peacekeeping duties in Sudan, also suggested militants had good intelligence on the military. Two other brigadiers were shot at in Islamabad, but survived. According to Gregory, over the last few years militants had launched attacks outside bases believed to be involved in part of Pakistan's nuclear infrastructure -- including the manufacture and assembly of components. They had also evolved forms of attack which could combine suicide bombers with ground assault teams. "This tactic could be used to penetrate even highly defended sites," he said. And while Pakistan's nuclear arsenals are thought to be stored deep within the country, possibly in Sind and Baluchistan provinces, nuclear weapons production sites in Punjab, scene of much of the latest violence, could prove more vulnerable. This would not mean the attackers would obtain a functioning nuclear bomb. And even if they were able to penetrate a nuclear production site, they would still have to manage the logistics under fire of removing the 25 kg (55 lb) of fissile material needed to make a nuclear bomb. But they could seize material for a dirty bomb -- which causes relatively few casualties but major environmental damage -- and valuable technology while scoring a propaganda co

<TITLE> Dhoni, Jadeja attempt resurrection </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Guwahati, India, Nov 08(bdnews24.com)-Mitchell Johnson found his mojo and combined with Doug Bollinger to reduce India to 27 for 5 before MS Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja fought hard to push it to 62 for 5 half-way through their innings in the sixth ODI at Guwahati. Were the conditions so English that the ball was swinging wildly? No. Was the pitch aiding alarming movement? No. There was just a bit of movement, in the air and off the pitch, and Australia exploited it superbly to bundle India out. Johnson, whose inability to swing the ball into the right-handers had blunted his threat in the recent times, found that inswing today and immediately looked a different bowler. With a slightly round-armish action which helped him to tilt the ball back in, Johnson gnawed away at the batsmen at disconcerting pace. For a year Australians have fretted and puzzled over this man's inconsistency. They were proud of his performances against South Africa and cussed him over his poor showing in Ashes but they have always known that Johnson is a different bowler when he gets that inswing going. Today was one such day. It was an early-morning start, the pitch was damp and there was hope in the air. The start wasn't flattering - his second delivery was whiplashed for a six over point by Virender Sehwag - but Johnson bounced back in the same over to start the demolition job. It was the full delivery, Sehwag shaped for his big drive but the ball curved in to thread the bat and pad gap and splayed the stumps. Egged on by the success, Johnson went from strength to strength and unfurled his full repertoire: The rapid pace, the extra bounce, the slinging round-arm, and the consistent line and length. He removed Gautam Gambhir with little bit of help from the batsman, who perhaps was swayed by Johnson's bad days when the ball wouldn't swing away from the left-handed batsmen. It was a delivery on the off and middle and Gambhir shaped to work it to the on side as if he expected the ball to angle in to his pads but to his horror, the ball straightened to take out to the off stump. Johnson went on to trouble Yuvraj Singh in the corridor before he took out Suresh Raina after harassing him with his bounce. There was something very obvious in the set-up - bowl a few short balls and push the batsman back before you slip in that fatal full delivery - but Raina fell for it again. Perhaps the ball stopped on him a bit, but Raina was late in getting forward to a full delivery and ended up flicking it straight to short mid-on. If Johnson created an opening with his incisive bowling, it was Doug Bollinger who provided the perfect supporting act with his unspectacular but consistent seam bowling. There is nothing flashy about Bollinger; you know what you will get from him: the steady line and length, the changes in pace, and the ability to bowl to his fields and it was enough today to get him two big wickets of Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh. Tendulkar was restricted to just one run from seven Bollinger deliveries when he pushed at a back-of-length ball a touch early. Perhaps, it stopped on him a bit and he ended up pushing it straight back to Bollinger who took a good reflex catch. There was a bit more luck in his second dismissal. The ball ricocheted off Yuvraj's pad over his right shoulder and as Yuvraj, clueless about where the ball went, turned behind to place the bat back inside the crease, he only succeeded in pushing the ball back to the stumps. At the half-way mark, India's good run in bilateral series - they have lost just two out of 14 since 2006 - looked most likely to end. 25 overs India 62 for 5 (Jadeja 19 , Dhoni 16 ) v Austral

<TITLE> Thousands of Japanese protest US base plan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GINOWAN, Japan, Nov 8,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of Japanese gathered in sweltering heat on the southern island of Okinawa on Sunday to demand that a US Marine base be moved out of the region, days ahead of a visit by US President Barack Obama. The row over the re-siting of the Futenma air base threatens to stall a realignment of the 47,000 U.S. military personnel in Japan and sour defence ties between the two countries, seen as key in a region home to a rising China and an unpredictable North Korea. It could also prove a domestic headache for Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, whose support ratings have slipped since his landslide election victory in August. "Okinawa's future is for us, the Okinawan people to decide," Ginowan mayor Yoichi Iha told a supportive crowd which spilled out of an open-air theatre by the beach. "We cannot let America decide for us." Organisers put the number of protesters at 21,000. Under a 2006 U.S.-Japan agreement, the Futenma Marine base in the centre of the city of Ginowan is set to be closed and replaced with a facility built partly on reclaimed land at Henoko, a remoter part of the island, by 2014. The deal, which Washington wants to push through after years of what a military official called "painful" negotiations, is part of a wider plan to re-organise U.S. troops and reduce the burden on Okinawa by moving up to 8,000 Marines to Guam. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has urged Japan to approve the plan ahead of Obama's visit, which is scheduled to start on Nov. 12. EMOTIVE ISSUE Hatoyama, who has vowed to build a more equal relationship with the United States, said in the run-up to his August election victory the base should be moved off the island. That view was supported by 70 percent of Okinawa residents in a poll published this month by the Mainichi newspaper. "I think getting rid of Futenma would be a good starting point for the removal of all the U.S. bases from Okinawa," said a 60-year-old woman at Sunday's protest, who gave her name only as Shinzato. Okinawa, controlled by the United States until 1972, makes up only 0.6 percent of Japan's land mass, but hosts about half the U.S. troops in Japan. Those who live near the bases complain of noise, crime, pollution and accidents. "It's such a wonderful place. It makes no sense to build it here," said Hiroshi Ashitomi, a long-time anti-base campaigner. Environmentalists are anxious to protect marine life including coral and rare dugongs in nearby waters. Others have different priorities. "Nature is important, but the primary responsibility of a politician is to protect people's lives and property," said Kosuke Gushi, a regional assemblyman with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party that signed off on the plan while in government. He and other backers of the existing plan, including Ginowan businessmen, say they are concerned re-opening the issue will mean an indefinite delay to the closure of Futenma, where a 2004 helicopter crash added to fears over safety. Gushi also sees the row as potentially undermining Japan's US-dependent security policy, leaving the country vulnerable. "If we can't provide the bases as we have pledged to do under the US-Japan security treaty, the Americans could pull out and say they are no longer responsible," Gushi said. Hatoyama has said he needs time to review the existing base plan, but his Defence Minister Toshimi Kitazawa has more or less endorsed the current agreem

<TITLE> River transport workers 'on strike' from midnight </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Nov 07 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh River Transport Workers Federation began an indefinite strike from Saturday midnight to press demands including better wages, a federation leader said. Shah Alam, senior vice president of the federation, told bdnews24.com that the strike had begun "as scheduled" at midnight after overnight launches had left terminals. He said passengers, goods and fishing vessels would all be observing the strike. "It will continue until our demands are met," he said. However, transport owners said they would not bow to the strikers. One top official of the River Transport Owners Association said, "We will operate as normal in the morning." Faruk Hossain, manager of river launch MV Tipu, told bdnews24.com, "Our launch will run despite the strike." Mahbubur Rahman, police sub-inspector at the capital's main Sadarghat Terminal, told bdnews24.com extra police and RAB teams have been deployed in case of trouble. There had been no untoward incident as the strike began, he added. Workers federation leader, Alam, said they were forced to call the strike as they did not receive any hint of a solution to problems even after setting a 15-day deadline on Oct 21. He said they had in fact been pressing their demands since August, which include a proper pay scale, effective application of riverine laws and a stop to harassment and robbery on river routes. Alam said they spoke with shipping minister Shahjahan Khan, river vessel owners and others about their demands, who all assured them of "solutions". But, said the federation leader, with no sign of progress, the river workers were forced to set a 15-day deadline on Oct 21. BIWTA director Shafiqul Haque told bdnews24.com: "Talks have taken place more than once, but no development has yet come out." He said he did not see any possibility that the workers would call off the strike. b

<TEXT>
 BELENE, Bulgaria, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - In the dense forests of the idyllic Danube island of Persin, home to the endangered sea eagle and the pygmy cormorant, lie the ghastly remains of a communist-era death camp. Hundreds "enemies of the regime" perished from beatings, malnutrition and exhaustion in 1949-59 in Bulgaria's Belene concentration camp, where dead bodies were fed to pigs. Twenty years after the fall of communism, Belene is largely forgotten -- only a small marble plaque tells its horrific story. And nostalgia for the past is growing in the small Balkan country and across the former Soviet bloc. Capitalism's failure to lift living standards, impose the rule of law and tame flourishing corruption and nepotism have given way to fond memories of the times when the jobless rate was zero, food was cheap and social safety was high. "(The bad) things have been forgotten," said Rumen Petkov, 42, a former guard now clerk at the only prison still functioning on the Persin island. "The nostalgia is palpable, particularly among the elderly," he said, in front of the crumbling buildings of another old jail opened on the site after the camp was shut in 1959. The communists imprisoned dozens of ethnic Turks here in the 1980s when they refused to change their names to Bulgarian. Some young people in the impoverished town of Belene, linked to the island with a pontoon bridge, also reminisce: "We lived better in the past," said Anelia Beeva, 31. "We went on holidays to the coast and the mountains, there were plenty of clothes, shoes, food. And now the biggest chunk of our incomes is spent on food. People with university degrees are unemployed and many go abroad." In Russia, several Soviet-themed restaurants have opened in Moscow in recent years: some hold nostalgia nights where young people dress up as pioneers -- the Soviet answer to the boy scouts and girl guides -- and dance to communist classics. Soviet Champagne and Red October Chocolates remain favourites for birthday celebrations. "USSR" T-shirts and baseball caps can be seen across the country in summer. While there is scant real desire for old regimes to be restored, analysts say apathy is a vital outcome. "The big damage of the nostalgia...is that it dries out the energy for meaningful change," wrote Bulgarian sociologist Vladimir Shopov in the online portal BG History. DISENCHANTMENT Across former communist eastern Europe, disenchantment with democracy is widespread and pollsters say mistrust of the elites who made people citizens of the European Union is staggering. A September regional poll by US Pew research centre showed support for democracy and capitalism has seen the biggest fall in Ukraine, Bulgaria, Lithuania and Hungary. The poll showed 30 percent of Ukrainians approved of the change to democracy in 2009, down from 72 percent in 1991. In Bulgaria and Lithuania the slide was to just over half the population from nearer three-quarters in 1991. Surveys by US-based human rights group Freedom House show backsliding or stagnation in corruption, governance, independent media and civil society in the new EU-member states. The global economic crisis, which has wounded the region and put an end to six or seven years of growth, is now challenging the remedy of neoliberal capitalism prescribed by the West. Hopes of catching up with the wealthy Western neighbours have been replaced by a sense of injustice because of a widening gap between the rich and the poor. In Hungary, one of the countries worst hit by economic downturn, 70 percent of those who were already adults in 1989 say they were disappointed with the results of the regime change, an October survey by pollster Szonda Ipsos showed. People in the former Yugoslav countries, scarred by the ethnic wars from the 1990s and still outside the EU, are nostalgic for the socialist era of Josip Broz Tito when, unlike now, they travelled across Europe without visa. "Everything was better then. There was no street crime, jobs were safe and salaries were enough for decent living," said Belgrade pensioner Koviljka Markovic, 70. "Today I can hardly survive with my pension of 250 euros ($370 a month)." GOLDEN ERA In Bulgaria, the 33-year rule of the late dictator Todor Zhivkov begins to seem a golden era to some in comparison with the raging corruption and crime that followed his demise. Over 60 percent say they lived better in the past, even though shopping queues were routine, social connections were the only way to obtain more valuable goods, jeans and Coca Cola were off-limits and it took up to 10 years' waiting to buy a car. "For part of the Bulgarians (social) security turned out to be more precious than freedom," wrote historians Andrei Pantev and Bozhidar Gavrilov in a book on the 100 most influential people in the Balkan country's history. Nearly three years after joining the EU, Bulgaria's average monthly salary of about 300 euros and pension of about 80 euros remain the lowest in the club. Incomes in the more affluent Poland and the Czech Republic, which joined the bloc in 2004, are also still a fraction of those in western Europe. A 2008 global survey by Gallup ranked Bulgaria, Serbia and Romania among the 10 most discontented countries in the world. "Our parents' generation was much more satisfied with what they had. Everybody just wants more of everything these days," said Zsofia Kis, a 23-year old student in Budapest, referring to the way communist regimes artifically held down unemployment. DALAVERA, MUTRI, MENTE After two decades of patchy, painful reforms, the majority of people refuse to make more sacrifices, as would be needed to complete a revamp of the economy and the judiciary. Demoralisation and heightened popularity for political parties promising "a firm hand" are other consequences. Not without reason. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, a former KGB agent, described the fall of the Soviet Union as the "the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century". Kremlin critics have accused the authorities of a creeping rehabilitation of the Soviet Union to justify their clampdowns on the media and opposition parties. "There is an idealisation of the Soviet past," said Nikita Petrov, an historian from the Memorial human rights group. "It's a conscious policy. They are trying to show the Soviet authorities looking decent and attractive to today's generation." In Bulgaria, oligarchs who control entire sectors of the economy have emerged from the former communist party's ranks and its feared secret services. The names of corrupt politicians and crime bosses are an open secret, but Bulgaria has not convicted a single senior official of graft and has jailed only one gang boss since 1989. No one has been convicted for the communist repressions. Some of the most popular words among ordinary Bulgarians are "dalavera", a Turkish word meaning fraud, "mutri", a nickname for ugly mafiosi and "mente", which means counterfeit products. "People are losing faith that one can achieve success in an honest, decent way. Success is totally criminalised," said Boriana Dimitrova of Bulgarian polling agency Alpha Research. She said the sense of injustice was particularly strong in the Balkans, Europe's poorest corner, where untouchable parallel structures of power reign. "Some people say: 'yes, the old regime was repressive but at least there was law and order.'" A promise to end the climate of impunity helped tough-talking Prime Minister Boiko Borisov of the centre-right populist GERB party to a landslide election win in Bulgaria in July. Public discontent and recession mean only populist governments can survive in the region, analysts say. "The level of mistrust in the political elite and institutions is so high that you cannot convince people to do anything under unpopular governments," said Ivan Krastev of Sofia's Liberal Strategies Institute. Some in Bulgaria accuse the West of duplicity for easily swallowing the communist past of members of the new elite. The election of Bulgarian Irina Bokova, 57, a former communist apparatchik and ambassador to Paris, as head of the UN culture and education body UNESCO in September was a stark example of the West's hypocrisy, critics say. Bokova studied in Moscow during the communism and climbed the diplomatic career ladder in the 1990s thanks to her past. "AMERICANISATION" On one front at least, some eastern Europeans say they have succeeded in catching up with and even outstripping capitalist standards -- the thirst for materialism. A big chunk of the loans taken in the boom years was spent on fancy cars and yachts, flat TV screens, designer clothes, silicon surgeries and exotic trips abroad. Copying foreign standards went as far as giving babies Western names and flooding TV screens with reality shows like "Big Brother". "Bulgaria is becoming Americanised," said renowned Bulgarian artist, Nikola Manev, who lives in Paris. "I pick up the phone and they talk to me in English, I go to a restaurant and it's called Miami. Don't we have our own names for God's sake? "Looking on the surface, I see new buildings, shops, shiny cars. But people have become sadder, more aggressive and unhappy," he said, prescribing spiritual cures. This autumn for the first time in many years, tickets at Sofia's theatres are selling out weeks in advan

<TITLE> Liverpool will not sell key players - Hicks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Liverpool will not be forced to sell off key players if the club make an early exit from the Champions League, co-owner Tom Hicks said. "None of our star players will be sold, regardless of results," the American told the Sunday Mirror. "The club is doing very well due to rapidly growing commercial revenues. "We have significant investor interest and want to make sure that we pick high-quality partners. "We are happy with the way things are going financially but we hoped things would be better on the pitch." The five-time European champions are in danger of being eliminated from the group stage of the Champions League despite having players such as England's Steven Gerrard and Spain's Fernando Torres. They have also lost five of their first 11 games in the Premier League and are seventh in the standings, nine points adrift of leaders Chelsea before Sunday's games. Liverpool have been keen to raise fresh cash to help challenge for top honours and fund the construction of a new stadium, as well as finance debt estimated at 245 million po

<TITLE> Real seek to repair damaged pride in King's Cup </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid midfielder Kaka believes the side can make up for their embarrassing 4-0 defeat to Alcorcon in the King's Cup, by staging a dramatic comeback at the Bernabeu in Tuesday's last-32 second leg (1900 GMT). Alcorcon, from Segunda B (the third tier of Spanish football), stunned the nine-times European champions in the first leg two weeks ago, in a result that raised questions over the future of coach Manuel Pellegrini. However, Real's reaction since then has quelled talk of a crisis and two wins and a draw in all competitions have given them confidence they can see off a side with a budget 400 times smaller than their own. "For pride and for the history of Real Madrid, we have to win this tie," Brazil's Kaka told the club website (www.realmadrid.com). "The players and the fans have to stand together. The Bernabeu must be a wave of pressure." Pellegrini will be unable to draw on the injured Cristiano Ronaldo and suspended Sergio Ramos but Alcorcon coach Juan Antonio Anquela was keeping his feet on the ground. "We are optimistic but realistic. If Real Madrid perform to their usual standards our chances of progressing are minimal," he told sports daily Marca on Monday. UNDER PRESSURE Other top-flight sides battling to stay in the competition against lower-league opposition are Tenerife, Racing Santander, Almeria and last year's finalists Athletic Bilbao, who all lost their first legs. The 23-times Cup winners Bilbao trail second division Rayo Vallecano 2-0 but have home advantage on Wednesday (2000). The Basques hope to have Spain striker Fernando Llorente back from injury in time for the game. Racing are 1-0 down against second division Salamanca on Wednesday (2000) and a run of eight matches without a win in all competitions has coach Juan Carlos Mandia under pressure to turn things round. "I expect to be coaching Racing for many weeks to come and I won't give up," Mandia responded when asked about his future after his side's 2-0 home league defeat to Bilbao on Sunday. Misfiring Atletico Madrid have a 2-0 lead over Segunda B side Marbella on Tuesday (1800), while fellow La Liga strugglers Villarreal are level at 1-1 for the visit of Segunda B's Puertollano on Tuesday (1900). Holders and La Liga leaders Barcelona have a 2-0 lead going into their clash with Segunda B's Cultural Leonesa at the Nou Camp on Tuesday (2

<TITLE> Market attack in Pakistan kills at least 12 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Nov 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed an anti-Taliban village mayor and 11 other people in an attack near Pakistan's volatile city of Peshawar on Sunday, officials said. The bomber blew himself up as Abdul Malik, mayor of Matni village, was visiting a market crowded with people and goats being sold for the upcoming Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha. Muslims slaughter goats, cows, buffaloes and camels on Eid al-Adha, which will be celebrated later this month. "Twelve people have been killed, including a four-year-old child, and 36 people are wounded," Mohammad Mukhtar, a doctor at Peshawar's main government hospital, told Reuters. Matni is close to the lawless tribal lands where Islamist militants are active. Islamist militants have unleashed a campaign of bomb and suicide attacks in Pakistan in recent weeks in retaliation for a major offensive launched by security forces in their main bastion, South Waziristan, on the Afghan border. The army on Sunday said 20 militants were killed in the latest fighting there, taking their total death toll to 478 since the offensive began. Forty-four soldiers have been killed in the same period, according to military figures. There was no independent verification of casualties as reporters and other independent observers are not allowed into the war zone. That assault in South Waziristan's rugged landscape of barren mountains and hidden ravines, now a center of global Islamist militancy, is being closely watched by the United States and other powers embroiled in Afghanistan. TALIBAN BACKER-TURNED-ENEMY To support their overall anti-militant drive, Pakistani authorities have encouraged Pashtun tribes to revive traditional militia to counter rising Islamist militancy. Malik was once a Taliban supporter, but switched loyalty to the government in recent years and had survived several assassination attempts by the militants. He was also head of a lashkar, or tribal militia, raised by the villagers against the militants. "He was pro-government and was deadly against the Taliban," Peshawar police chief Liaquat Ali Khan said. Militants have killed numerous pro-government tribal elders over the past few years, and have stepped up attacks recently. Last month, more than 100 people were killed in a car bombing in Peshawar in the deadliest attack in the country in two years. More than 150 people were killed in attacks before the army began the assault in South Waziristan. The army went on the offensive in the ethnic Pashtun region on October 17 aiming to root out Pakistani Taliban militants behind a wave of violence in urban areas. Soldiers have been advancing into the militant heartland from three directions and had entered their headquarters of Makeen on Fri

<TITLE> New star Taylor Lautner rises in "New Moon" </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, Nov 9(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Women swooned for Robert Pattinson as vampire Edward Cullen in last year's hit movie romance "Twilight," but in its upcoming sequel Taylor Lautner, who almost didn't make it into the film, is the newest hunk for fan's to feast on. "The Twilight Saga: New Moon" rises in theaters on November 20 as one of the most-anticipated movies early in Hollywood's holiday season. Predecessor "Twilight" made $384 million at worldwide box offices in 2008, and its young principal actors, Pattinson and Kristen Stewart, shot to overnight stardom. But in "New Moon," the second romance about the netherworld adventures of teenager Bella Swan (Stewart) and the love of her life Cullen, it is Lautner who grabs the spotlight. He portrays American werewolf Jacob Black, Swan's protector when Cullen leaves her to go to Italy. Black's devotion to Swan has earned him -- and that means Lautner, too -- the devotion of millions of young girls obsessed with author Stephenie Meyer's "Twilight" books on which the movies are based. "We have fans all the time that will just burst into tears, it's just moving," he said. "It must mean so much for them to meet us, and it's an amazing feeling to know that you can touch someone in that way." Prior to "Twilight," the 17-year-old Lautner was best known for his starring role in 2005 children's film "The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D." And in 2008's hit vampire film, the Jacob Black role was a small one as Swan's childhood friend. So, Lautner is relatively new to the stardom "New Moon" is bringing, and the teenager seems to be enjoying it. STARDOM ALMOST FADED But for a time it appeared the studio behind "Twilight," Summit Entertainment, might not hire him for the sequel. When Summit left Lautner's name out of a statement announcing the other actors for "New Moon," including Pattinson and Stewart, "Twilight" fans protested stridently, and their Internet-based campaign brought Lautner back from the dead. "The doubts came up because he had very few scenes in the first movie, and also because he's described as being 6'5'' in the second book, so there were reasonable facts that we had to come to grips with," said "New Moon" director Chris Weitz. To gain the stature he needed for the role of Black in "New Moon," Lautner set about bulking up. He said he worked out regularly and ate every two hours, which involved carrying around a baggie full of beef, raw almonds and sweet potatoes. In "New Moon," Black regularly runs, jumps and flexes his muscular frame, and when Bella is wounded, he rips off his shirt to staunch her bleeding head. Lautner said the last scene -- one of many where he is bare-chested -- makes him laugh. But he knows moments like those are what causes "New Moon's" target audience of teenage girls to swoon. They did for Pattinson in "Twilight", and well before the sequel hits theaters, they are for Lautner, too. In an online poll last month by AOL's JSYK.com, a website aimed at teens and tweens, Lautner surged past Pattinson in both the favorite male movie star and "cool guy you'd like to hang out with" categories. When asked by reporters if he thought he could win in a fight with Pattinson -- werewolf against vampire; old teen heartthrob against new one -- Lautner laughed and said: "He actually does a lot of boxing in his time off, so it would be a good match-

<TITLE> Flintoff admits comeback may be delayed </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com) -- Andrew Flintoff has a three-year Lancashire deal under his belt, but is unsure when he will be able to return to the cricket field as he continues a slow recovery from post-Ashes knee surgery, reports Cricinfo. In his original time scale he had earmarked the one-day series against Bangladesh, starting at the end of February, but admitted that may now be "unrealistic". Although in good spirits as he discussed his new county deal and reiterated his desire to develop his one-day game Flintoff, who flew in from his temporary home in Dubai for the Old Trafford press conference, has only recently come off crutches almost 12 weeks after the operation he had the day after England regained the Ashes. "I said I'd like to go to Bangladesh with the one-day squad, but that might be unrealistic," he said. "I've got the IPL after that and then the Twenty20 World Cup. I've been off the crutches for nearly two weeks but I can't run yet. I've just started gentle cycling, and I've been spending a lot of time in the pool, and just generally ticking over. "I'm just under 12 weeks since the op. I'll probably know more at the 12-week stage, I'll see the surgeon, he'll re-scan me and he will have a better idea of how the operation has gone and where I'm at with it. "He is pretty confident, as am I. So far it's just been doing a lot of the boring stuff. After I've had the scan I can build back up to running and hopefully get in the nets and start practising some time after Christmas. First and foremost I want to get on a cricket field again." Peter Moores, the Lancashire coach, was similarly cautious about Flintoff's comeback schedule, but was confident that the club hadn't been over ambitious in offering the all-rounder a lengthy contract despite his injury problems. "I don't think so. He is still in rehab and is to get fit but it's all going to schedule at the moment," Moores said. "Fred said to start with his target was Bangladesh just after Christmas but that might be a little bit early, and internationally then there is the Twenty20 World Cup." Though Flintoff's England comeback may now be at the World Twenty20 in West Indies, his first return to action could be for the Chennai Super Kings at the IPL in March. He has one year left on his current deal having made a brief appearance at the 2009 event before returning home with the first occurrence of his knee problem. Since turning down an ECB incremental contract, Flintoff has been linked with a number of other Twenty20 sides around the world including states in Australia and South African franchises. He remains keen to take up these opportunities, but insists he will put his England and Lancashire priorities first. "I'm not going to give up Test cricket and then kill myself playing any other cricket I can find," he said. "I want to play tournaments and games which excite me. The IPL is obviously one of them, and I'm contracted to Chennai for another year, and there's Lancashire and England too, if selected. "Personally, I'd also like to try and play in Australia. I wanted to go at 16 but my Mum wouldn't let me. I worked at Woolworths instead, but as I said, I won't be killing myself by playing anything and everyth

<TITLE> Muhith takes hard line on RMG incentives </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com) The government has again taken a hard line on providing financial incentive package to apparel sector seeking funds to bounce from a downturn induced by global meltdown, the finance minister says. "It is not right that it will not be the end of the world if a child cries. The government will have to consider about all sectors," A M A Muhith told bdnews24.com on Monday. He was asked whether the readymade garment sector will get the assistance. "Those sectors will come under incentive package that have been really affected by economic recession," Muhith said at the Secretariat. A committee, formed on the RMG sector with former finance minister M Saiduzzaman as the head, will meet on Tuesday. The government will act on the recommendations of committee, the minister said. The industry's top trade body, Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association, at a media briefing on Sunday said they saw a 30 percent dip in spot orders from buyers at this year's BATEXPO, the country's largest apparel fair. Spot orders at last year's expo amounted to $55.45 million; this year they totalled just $41.64 million, BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedi said. Murshedi sought assistance from the government under incentive package. Opposition chief Khaleda Zia at the closing ceremony of BATEXPO also urged the government to give a portion of the financial stimulus package to the apparel sector. But, minister Muhith said: "This is not a serious matter. The rise and decline of export in a sector is very natural. "We should not think that everything will be over if a sector suffers less export." In April, the government rolled out a stimulus package of Tk 3,424 crore. However, the two major trade bodies of the garments industry, the BGMEA and Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, were highly critical as the highest export-earning RMG sector was excluded altogether from the proposed package. The two trade bodies later welcomed the revised Tk 5,000 crore package included in the FY 2009-10 budget, although they again expressed concern that the RMG sector still received no specific allocation. On Sept 3, Murshedi said the sector required its own financial package of Tk 3,000 crore by Sep 7 to salvage the industry and help clear worker wages and allowances ahead of Eid. The ultimatum was widely criticised by government, workers, unions and even other business organisations. Muhith had rejected the demand, saying it was not right for the industry leaders to link the issue of financial support with worker dues ahead of Eid. The BGMEA later issued an apology for their request, saying "mistakes in language" and "frustration deriving from the global recession" had prompted their appeal. BKMEA president M Fazlul Hoque said they did not expect much from Tuesday's meeting. He told bdnews24.com on Monday: "We are frustrated. The government is not admitting that the garment sector has been affected by recession." According to Export Processing Bureau data given on Sunday, export in knitwear sector had dropped by 27 percent in September compared to the same period of the last year and fell 9 percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year. "This proves that the impact of global recession have hit us. To get over the loss we are seeking assistance in the form of incentive from the government," the BKMEA chief explained. To tackle the global recession the government formed a taskforce in April with the representatives of public and private sectors and economists and researchers, with the finance minister heading. The taskforce held its first meeting on April 19. The government based the Tk 3,500 crore incentive package on the recommendations of the taskforce. The taskforce in its second meeting on Sept 16 decided to form a committee to deal with the recession. The nine-member committee was formed on Sept 21 with former finance minister M Saiduzzaman. The committee is scheduled to hold a meeting at 10:30am on Tuesday at the finance ministry. bd

<TEXT>
 KABUL, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NATO forces mistakenly killed seven Afghan soldiers and police in an air strike during a battle while searching for two missing American soldiers in Afghanistan, the Afghan Defence Ministry said on Saturday. The NATO-led force confirmed the deaths and said it was investigating whether its air strikes were responsible. It said an eighth Afghan, a civilian working with the military, was also killed, and 18 Afghans and five American soldiers were wounded. The battle took place on Friday during a manhunt for the two soldiers who went missing on Wednesday. "Yesterday, in a NATO air strike, seven Afghan (soldiers and police) were martyred in Badghis province," Afghan Defence Ministry spokesman General Zaher Azimy said. Friday's battle took place during a search and rescue operation for two soldiers from the US 82nd Airborne Division, who went missing after a resupply mission. The Taliban and provincial officials in Badghis say the two missing Americans drowned in a river. A Taliban spokesman said the militants had recovered their bodies. NATO says the search is still under way. US Navy Captain Jane Campbell, a spokeswoman for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), said: "We are saddened by the loss of life and injuries sustained during this very important mission." The force, along with Afghan authorities, was "currently investigating whether some of the casualties were caused by ISAF close air support", NATO said in a statement. Lieutenant Todd Vician, a NATO press officer, confirmed that the alliance had launched air strikes during the search. Reports of missing soldiers in Afghanistan are extremely rare and immediately prompt a large-scale military response. Troops from more than 40 nations are in the nearly 110,000-strong NATO-led force.

<TITLE> Italy hammer United States to win Fed Cup </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 REGGIO CALABRIA, Italy, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy surged to their second Fed Cup title by destroying the United States 4-0 in the final on Sunday. Flavia Pennetta charged past Melanie Oudin 7-5, 6-2 in the third singles rubber to give an unassailable 3-0 lead to the hosts, who were helped by Serena and Venus Williams again opting not to compete for the US. Italy, who first won the trophy in 2006 and overcame defending champions Russia in this year's semi-finals, had never beaten the Americans in nine previous Fed Cup ties. "It's incredible, the girls have rewritten the history of Italian tennis," captain Corrado Barazzutti told reporters at the courtside before being showered with champagne. Pennetta, the world number 11, put Italy 1-0 up on Saturday when she comfortably beat Alexa Glatch before a confident Francesca Schiavone also defeated Oudin. The Americans, who have racked up a record 17 Fed Cup titles but have not lifted the trophy since 2000, continually struggled and failed to win a set in the singles. EARLY BOOST Oudin, 18, gave Pennetta a great early boost by netting a simple shot and surrendering her serve in the first game. Pennetta consistently dominated but suffered a wobble when Oudin broke back at 5-5 on the outdoor clay court. The American then double faulted to lose serve in the next game and hand back the advantage to the Italian, who quickly sealed the set under overcast skies. A partisan crowd in southern Italy and some slow ball girls increasingly irritated Oudin, the top-ranked US player at 49. She fell apart in the second set and was broken three times, allowing Pennetta the luxury of dropping her own service once before securing victory to the delight of nearly 4,000 fans. "I feel like I let my team down and the whole US too," Oudin said. The fourth singles match between Schiavone and Glatch was scrapped with Italy already having triumphed, leaving Sara Errani and Roberta Vinci to entertain the fans with victory over Vania King and Liezel Huber in the doubles. They won 4-6, 6-3 and 11-9 in a super tiebreak instead of a third set. Italy, now the top-ranked Fed Cup team for the first time while their men continue to flounder in the Davis Cup, will start the defence of the title against Ukraine in February.

 DUBAI, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has regained control of territory seized by Yemeni rebels in a cross-border incursion last week that prompted a military response from Riyadh, a top official was quoted as saying. "The situation is calm ... especially in Jabal Dukhan, of which full control has been regained," Prince Khaled bin Sultan bin Abdul-Aziz, assistant minister for defense and aviation, said on Saturday, according to the Saudi Press Agency (SPA). Saudi Arabia on Thursday launched air strikes on rebels in northern Yemen after the Shi'ite insurgents crossed the border into the kingdom and said they had taken control of an area called Jabal Dukhan, which means "mountain of smoke." On Saturday, Prince Khaled said three members of the Saudi security forces were killed and 15 others were wounded in fighting on the Saudi-Yemeni border, according to SPA. Four Saudi soldiers were missing, Prince Khaled said, but said they had not been taken prisoner. He also said Saudi security forces had also arrested a number of rebels.

 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)River transport workers called off their countrywide indefinite strike on Monday after tripartite talks between the shipping secretary, transport owners and leaders of workers. Negotiation's the previous day had failed. Shipping secretary Abdul Mannan Hawlader told reporters after Monday's talks that the leaders of workers had agreed to withdraw strike. He said a 16-member committee was formed with Lokman Hakim Talukder, director of the Directorate of Labour, as its head to prepare recommendations after reviewing the workers' demands, including pay issues. The committee has been asked to report in two months, Hawlader said. Chowdhury Atiqul Alam, general secretary of the Federation who was present in the meeting, said they would ask the workers to go back to work soon and not get confused by any provocation Bangladesh River Transport Workers Federation, a coalition of workers unions, enforced the strike to press home their 22-point charter of demands. The demands include a reasonable pay scale, effective application of riverine laws and curbing harassment and robbery on the river routes. The federation leaders had unsuccessful talks with the shipping secretary on Sunday. The strike paralysed river communication, causing trouble to thousands of passengers and disrupting transportation of goods. bdnews24.com correspondent reported only one vessel reached Sadarghat terminal in Dhaka early morning that had set out from Bhola prior to the start of the strike enforced Saturday midnight. bdne

<TITLE> Bollinger fizzes as India skittled out for 170 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GUWAHATI, India, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A five-wicket haul by left-arm seamer Doug Bollinger helped Australia restrict India to 170 in 48 overs in the sixth one-day international on Sunday. New ball bowler Bollinger dismissed Sachin Tendulkar (10) and Yuvraj Singh (6) off successive overs in his opening spell before claiming Mahendra Dhoni (24), Ravindra Jadeja (57) and Harbhajan Singh for a duck. All-rounders Jadeja and Praveen Kumar (54 not out) struck fifties and shared in a 74-run stand for the eighth wicket to lift the hosts, who were tottering at 27 for five. Spearhead Mitchell Johnson gave the world champions a spectacular start by dismissing opener Virender Sehwag (6) and in-form Gautam Gambhir (zero) in the first over of the match after India chose to bat first.

Johnson, rested for the previous game, sent back Suresh Raina as the hosts lost half their side by the ninth over.

<TITLE> Australia win one-day series in India </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GUWAHATI, India, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Left-arm seamer Doug Bollinger grabbed five for 35 to set up Australia's six-wicket victory over India in the sixth one-dayer Sunday for an unassailable 4-2 lead in the seven-match series. New ball bowler Bollinger dismissed Sachin Tendulkar (10) and Yuvraj Singh (6) off successive overs in his opening spell before claiming Mahendra Dhoni (24), Harbhajan Singh (zero) and Ravindra Jadeja for 57 to bowl out India for 170. All-rounders Jadeja and Praveen Kumar (54 not out) struck fifties and shared in a 74-run stand for the eighth wicket to lift the hosts, who were tottering at 27 for five after choosing to bat first on a two-paced pitch. In-form Shane Watson struck 49 but the world champions suffered a mini collapse when off-spinner Harbhajan Singh took Watson and Ricky Ponting (25) in quick succession. Michael Hussey (35 not out) put on 53 for the fourth wicket with Cameron White (25) and 29 with Adam Voges (23 not out) to guide the team to victory in 41.5 overs. Injury-hit Australia had five players sent back from the series with injuries. Spearhead Mitchell Johnson gave Australia a spectacular start by dismissing opener Virender Sehwag (6) and Gautam Gambhir (zero) in the first over of the match. The left-arm pacer, rested for the previous game, then sent back Suresh Raina for nought as the hosts lost half their side by the ninth over. Dhoni (24) put on 48 with Jadeja for the sixth wicket before he fell lbw to man of the match Bollinger, playing in his seventh game, who then removed Harbhajan two balls later. Jadeja rode his luck while Kumar batted with pluck to take the home side past the 150-mark. Australia, who won the Champions Trophy last month, won their third straight game in the series after having been 2-1 down. Opener Shaun Marsh fell early but Watson, who cracked 93 in the previous game, put on 61 with Ponting for the second wicket. Harbhajan foxed Watson and Ponting in successive overs on a turning pitch but vice-captain Hussey helped Australia win their second straight series victory in India following their 4-2 win two years ago. The last match will be played in Mumbai Wednesday.

<TITLE> Britons not convinced Afghan war can be won:Stirrup </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 8,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britons are not convinced the war in Afghanistan can be won, Britain's chief of defence staff said on Sunday, as two new polls showed support for the war was dwindling. "People remain to be convinced about whether or not this is doable," Jock Stirrup, told the BBC. His comments came as the defence ministry announced the 231st British military death since fighting began in 2001, the eighth in the last week. "We have not done a sufficiently good job in answering three basic questions," he said. "Is it important enough to us as a country, to our security, to justify the price that our people are paying? ... is it physically doable? ... and are we doing it properly?" Two polls published on Remembrance Sunday showed public support for the war has fallen, a blow to Prime Minister Gordon Brown who has this week sought to bolster backing at home to keep British troops in Afghanistan. Continuing loss of British lives in Afghanistan could damage Brown's Labour Party in an election he must call by next June and which the opposition Conservatives are favourites to win. A ComRes poll for the BBC found 64 percent of Britons now believe the war is "unwinnable", up from 58 percent in July, while two-fifths of people said they did not know why British forces were in Afghanistan. More than half agreed that corruption in Afghanistan's government meant the war was "not worth fighting for". Stirrup said the troops were not there to defend the Afghan government, reiterating Brown's comments earlier this week that British troops were there to protect Britain from terrorism. "We are there to hold the security ring so that political solutions can be delivered, but we are only holding the security ring until the Afghans are capable of doing it themselves." He said he thought the estimates of General Stanley McChrystal, commander of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan, that the Afghan national army would be able to take over security by 2013 were "optimistic", and said 2014 was likely. A YouGov poll for Sky news found that support for the war had dropped to 21 percent, from 28 percent in August, while 63 percent said British troops should not be in Afghanistan, up from 57 percent three months

<TITLE> Japan urges Myanmar to release Suu Kyi before poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan urged Myanmar on Saturday to release detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi before next year's election, adding it was ready to provide more aid if democratisation in the country advanced. The comments came a few days after a US delegation made a landmark visit to Myanmar as part of a new policy of engagement by the Obama administration. "It is extremely important that Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners are all released before the general election to be held in 2010," Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama told Myanmar's visiting prime minister, according to a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman. Hatoyama also urged General Thein Sein to ensure all stakeholders could take part in the election. Japan has distanced itself from the policy of Western powers, which have imposed tough sanctions on Myanmar, and from that of China, which has pumped billions of dollars into the country. It has prefered engagement and dialogue to push for democratisation of the authoritarian military-run state, and welcomed Washington's recent move, saying it was getting closer to Tokyo's approach. The talk between Hatoyama and General Thein Sein took place on the sidelines of the Tokyo summit among Japan and five Mekong region countries -- Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. It was the first time since 2003 a Myanmar leader had visited Japan. Hatoyama acknowledged signs of improvement in the democratisation process in the country formerly known as Burma, and welcomed improving ties between Washington and Myanmar. "Based on recent positive moves, Japan will gradually expand its assistance to Myanmar in areas of humanitarian assistance, including those through NGOs, and human development assistance," Hatoyama was quoted as telling General Thein Sein. "If the general election in 2010 is conducted in a manner we expect, Japan will be in a position to strengthen its assistance to Myanmar," he added. In the fiscal year that ended in March 2008, Japan provided 1.18 billion yen ($13.13 million) in grant aid and 1.64 billion yen in technical assistance to Myanm

<TITLE> BB boss sees growth spurt from ACH </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh will achieve an extra one percent in GDP growth once the central bank's Automated Clearing House starts operating in full swing, the Bangladesh Bank governor said Sunday. "After the revolutionary step of introducing internet-based e-commerce, Bangladesh Bank is going to set another milestone by launching an international standard secured payment system," Atiur Rahman said at a press conference marking the trial launch of the automated cheque clearing system. He said, "A modern payment system plays a positive role for economic growth in any country." Research demonstrates that some countries have been able to achieve an extra one percent economic growth after introducing such a system, said the central bank boss. "Bangladesh will add an extra one percent too," he said. The long-awaited Automated Clearing House will allow rapid electronic inter-bank cheque transfers within the country and automatic adjustment of accounts. Rahman said the next step would be Electronic Fund Transfer for rapid worldwide inter-bank transactions. For the present, inter-bank cheque clearing within Bangladesh is done manually, holding up vast volumes of business for days. Under the new ACH system, a single machine will be capable of clearing at least 300 cheques in a minute, said Rahman, adding that two such machines have been installed at the central bank. Deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank, Ziaul Hasan Siddiqui, said, "Under the present system, it takes three days for a cheque to clear within Dhaka." "But when launched, the new system will clear a single cheque in a day in Dhaka." "Outside Dhaka, it may take two or three days from the current 15 to 20 days," said Siddiqui. "Most of the country's banks, along with Bangladesh Bank, have taken necessary steps to introduce the new system," said Rahman. "Some banks are yet to complete their preparations. The procedure will come into operation in full swing once all the banks are ready." State-run Janata Bank and the private Dutch-Bangla Bank and Eastern Bank launched trial ACH operations on Sunday. The prime minister is expected to fully inaugurate the system within a few months, said the governor. "The introduction of a modern cheque clearing system will pave the way for the present government's dream of a 'Digital Bangladesh'," he added. The UK's Department for International Development provided  13.5 million to launch the project. DfID resident representative Chris Austin and Bangladesh Bank executive director cum project director Chowdhury Mohidul Haq also spoke at the press conference. bd

 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)Terrorists are getting their hands on small and light firearms seized by law enforcers in South Asia although they should have been destroyed, the finance minister says. "Those arms need to be destroyed since the terrorists get those again," AMA Muhith said at a regional seminar on Sunday. "It'll bring comfort to all," Muhith told the two-day seminar on 'Peace and Security in South Asia: Issues and Preferences to Control Small and Light Firearms' at a hotel in Dhaka. However, in the beginning of his speech Muhith was confused about his invitation. "It's not clear why I have been asked to inaugurate (the seminar) or given the honour of 'chief guest' of the seminar on this topic." According to statistics in 2001, the latest available figure, Muhith said there are some 5 billion small arms in the world and 5,000 people are killed every day on average in gunfire, "which is alarming". "Arms worth $1,464 billion were traded in 1981 during the Cold War. The business saw a downturn following the knock-down of 'Berlin Wall' in 1989-90. But after the 9/11 terrorist attack on the Twin Towers, the business soared again." Land mines were the most preferred means in earlier days. But now the small and light arms have seen a rise in demand, the minister said. Government representatives and experts from the SAARC countries, China and the United Nations attended the seminar organised by the Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS), a government-run research centre. bdn

<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)--Three Bangladeshis were killed and four others injured in a fire at a house in New York early on Saturday, the New York Times said. Referring to neighbours and Fire Department officials, the newspaper said the fire 'started in the basement of an illegally subdivided house in Queens'. Police identified one of the dead as SD Jahan, 31. Others could not be identified immediately. "Neighbours said they were in their 30s and all of them were from Bangladesh", NY Times said. Two died at the scene while the third one died of cardiac arrest on the way to hospital. The two-storey wood-frame house is owned by Subir and Marina Barua. Nayan Barua, a friend of the owners, said two of the dead men had lived in the house and the third was a guest. The house is used as a cultural centre and a boarding house as well for members of Bangladesh's Buddhist community, the newspaper said quoting the neighbours and relatives of the owners. Subir Barua is the president of the executive committee listed on the website of the World Barua Organisation which describes itself as a "nonpolitical, socio-cultural and welfare organisation", the newspaper said. bd

<TITLE> Obama wraps up Afghan review, eyes final options </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President Barack Obama is wrapping up deliberations on war strategy in Afghanistan and is considering final Pentagon options that include sending about 30,000 more troops, officials said on Saturday. A deployment of that size would be less than the 40,000-troop increase recommended by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the commander of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan, but more than many of Obama's Democratic allies may support. Record combat deaths have eroded US public support for the war, and a decision to expand troop levels could become a political liability for the president ahead of congressional elections next year. Currently, there are about 67,000 US troops and 40,000 allied forces in Afghanistan. Under one of the final Pentagon options presented to the White House, three additional combat brigades would be deployed and a division headquarters set up near Kandahar in southern Afghanistan, a Taliban stronghold, as part of a 30,000-troop increase. US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Obama has settled on a troop increase but has yet to make up his mind about its size. Brigades generally include 3,500 to 4,000 troops, though they can swell to over 5,000 troops if other units are attached. Marine brigades can be larger. Obama, who will visit Asia from Nov 12-19, is expected to announce his decision within a few weeks, possibly after Afghan President Hamid Karzai's inauguration. Karzai was re-elected in a controversial poll tainted by fraud. The timing may hinge on the extent to which Karzai embraces U.S. and European calls for a pact under which his government would commit to taking concrete steps to fight corruption and improve governance, including the delivery of public services. Washington believes a successful counterinsurgency strategy against the Taliban hinges in large part on winning Afghan public support for the government in Kabul. But Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the US military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said earlier this week that the re-elected president's legitimacy among the Afghan people was "at best, in question right now and, at worst, doesn't exist." OPTIONS NARROW Senior Obama administration officials have stepped up consultations with key allies, laying the ground for an announcement on strategy and troop levels. In his confidential troop request, McChrystal said 40,000 additional troops were needed to help secure Afghan population centers and to give NATO some additional resources to take on Taliban and al Qaeda fighters in outlying areas. Another option, deemed more risky by McChrystal, calls for between 10,000 and 15,000 more troops, which would enable the commander to focus on securing population centers but provide few additional resources to broaden the anti-Taliban campaign. A third option -- to send an additional 80,000 troops to mount a more robust counterinsurgency against the Taliban across the country -- was widely seen as a non-starter from the onset of the White House review. Support for continuing a counterinsurgency strategy with a greater focus on protecting major Afghan population centers has been growing within the Obama administration. Counterinsurgency advocates include Defense Secretary Robert Gates and military leaders, including McChrystal. Officials said this strategy could be combined with a stepped up counterterrorism campaign, advocated by Vice President Joe Biden, using unmanned aerial drones and special operations forces to combat Taliban and al Qaeda fighters in the Afghan countryside and near the border with Pakist

<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court has asked the government why the MPs should not be removed as advisers to the Upazila Parishad, a local government body. The bench of justices Mohammad Anwarul Haque and A H M Shamsuddin Chowdhury issued the order on Sunday on a petition filed by three Upazila chairmen of Manikganj. It asked the government why the provision of appointing the MPs as advisers to Upazila Parishad and their approval in the planning of development programme should not be declared illegal. It also asked the government why the provision of keeping the Upazila Nirbahi officers presidents of standing committees instead of secretaries should not be declared illegal. The government has had four weeks to give the reply to the rule. Manikganj's Gheor Upazila chairman Afzal Hossain Khan, Saturia Upazila's Abdul Majid and Sadar Upazila's Ataur Rahman Ata filed the plea on Sunday. Kamal Hossain and Shahdin Malik argued for the petitioners. Malik told reporters after the ruling: "The rule has been issued asking the government why the four sections of the amended Upazila Parishad Act should not be declared illegal. Parliament on April 6 passed the Upazila Parishad (Amendment) Act 2009 restoring powers of MPs over the councils and making the elected chairmen virtually toothless. The Upazila chairmen have been protesting against the Act since then. According to the new law, recommended by the parliamentary standing committee on local government, elected chairmen will mainly be in charge of planning and monitoring development programmes at the grassroots. bdne

<TITLE> Internet censorship seen liable to WTO challenge </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GENEVA, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Censorship of the Internet is open to challenge at the World Trade Organization as it can restrict trade in services delivered online, a forthcoming study says. A censorship case at the WTO could raise sovereignty issues, given the clear right of member states to restrict trade on moral grounds -- for example, by blocking access to child pornography websites. But a WTO ruling could set limits on blanket censorship and compel states instead to use more selective filtering, according to the study, to be published on Thursday by think-tank ECIPE. "Censorship is the most important non-tariff barrier to the provision of online services, and a case might clarify the circumstances in which different forms of censorship are WTO-consistent," said the study by Brian Hindley and Hosuk Lee-Makiyama. "Many WTO member states are legally obliged to permit an unrestricted supply of cross-border Internet services," they wrote in their report, obtained in advance by Reuters. Many countries censor the Internet for political or moral reasons. China has developed one of the most pervasive systems, in Cuba all unauthorized surfing is illegal, and many Western countries limit access to child porn sites. Internet use is particularly strong in Asia. China, with 298 million people online, overtook the United States in numbers of Internet users in 2008, the study said. BUSINESS IMPACT Internet censorship can have a serious impact on businesses, it said, noting how local search engine Baidu, which follows official rules on censorship, has overtaken global leader Google in the Chinese market. There have even been reports that the authorities rerouted requests for Google.com and other international search engines to Baidu's site. In the third quarter of 2009 Baidu had 64 percent of the 2 billion yuan ($293 million) Internet search market in China, while Google had 31.3 percent. Back in 2002, Baidu had 3 percent and Google 24 percent, the study said. In Japan, where Google might face similar linguistic entry barriers to China, foreign-owned search engines have more than 90 percent of the market. A challenge at the WTO by Antigua to US laws restricting online gambling showed that a member's commitment -- once made -- to opening up in a sector takes precedence over subsequent bans and restrictions, even if they do not discriminate between domestic and foreign suppliers, the study noted. And a WTO panel ruled against Chinese restrictions on imports of audio-visual entertainment, including the use of domestic distributors to control access to the material, in response to a US challenge. China is appealing against that ruling. WTO rules allow members to restrict trade to protect public morals or public order, but those measures must be necessary and disrupt trade as little as possible. The study argues that a strong case can be made against disproportionate censorship that disrupts commercial activities by more than necessary to achieve the goals of the censoring government. Proportionate censorship would mean selective filtering rather than arbitrary and entire blockages or permanent bans. Some states might argue such filtering would impose an impractical burden, but others, such as China with its "Golden Shield" -- known in the West as the "Great Firewall of China" -- already have well-staffed infrastructure in place for selective censorship. "There is a good chance that a panel might rule that permanent blocks on search engines, photo-sharing applications and other services are inconsistent with (WTO services) provisions, even given morals and security exceptions," it sa

<TITLE> Morkel blast lifts S Africa to 295 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  South Africa's batting line-up enjoyed a useful workout in the opening ODI against Zimbabwe in Benoni on Sunday as they reached an impressive 295-5, reports Cricinfo. Hashim Amla top-scored with a fluent 80 while AB de Villiers also looked in fine touch for a run-a-ball 51. The late acceleration came from Albie Morkel's 39-ball half century and Alvrio Petersen, recalled to a new role in the middle order, as the batting Powerplay brought 58 runs. However, the home side didn't have it all their own way as the Zimbabwe spinners kept a lid on the scoring rate during the middle of the innings with Ray Price taking three wickets. Amla and captain Graeme Smith gave the innings a solid base, although Smith struggled for his timing to begin with as he settled in on a sluggish surface. Amla was the more fluent early on, but Smith soon found his range with a couple of boundaries off Chamu Chibhabha and took Chris Mpofu for a huge six over deep midwicket. It was the introduction of spin that brought the breakthrough as Smith picked out deep square-leg with a slog-sweep. Amla and de Villiers both moved along comfortably against the slow bowlers in a significant innings for the second-wicket pair. De Villiers, meanwhile, has been moved up the order to No 3, with Arthur wanting to give him more time to build an innings and improve on a slightly disappointing return of three centuries in 89 ODIs. He certainly had time today to register hundred No 4, moving effortlessly to a 48-ball half-century, before picking out long-off where Mark Vermeulen held a well-judged catch. Zimbabwe now managed to haul in the scoring rate with Amla content to work the field while Mark Boucher struggled to find his timing. Amla was set to bat through the innings when, much to his disgust, he deposited a long hop from Graeme Cremer down deep midwicket and three overs later, Boucher's laboured effort ended with a miscued drive to long-off. Morkel gave himself a few overs to settle then the Powerplay was taken. The first two over went for just five each, but then the boundaries started to flow with the next three costing 48. Morkel collected three sixes, including a tracer-bullet blow flat over long-on during his second ODI half-century to go alongside the 97 he made in the previous meeting between these two sides. Petersen, playing his first ODI since March 2008, supported well with a sprightly effort as South Africa's superior skills were made to c

<TITLE> Cold War frontier gone in Germany, remains in Korea </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - As a united Germany marks the 20th anniversary of the Berlin Wall's fall on Monday, about 1 million soldiers face off across the Cold War's last great divide -- the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas. The 4-km (2.5-mile) wide no man's land, established under the ceasefire that ended the 1950-53 Korean War, runs 245 km (150 miles). It divides the peninsula with razor-wire fences, minefields and one of the heaviest collection of armaments on earth. The Berlin Wall anniversary has sparked a longing in South Korea for unity but also worries about the enormous costs involved if the DMZ was dismantled and North and South Korea were united. "The economic gap between the two Koreas is far wider than that of the two Germanys before reunification," the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper said in an editorial. North Korea is an economic backwater, with annual GDP of $17 billion in 2008 -- two percent the size of the South's economy. By some estimates it would cost more than $1 trillion for South Korea to absorb the North, the only real scenario in the event of reunification. That would wreak havoc on South Korea's economy, with a state-funded research agency saying it would raise the tax bill for South Koreans by the equivalent of two percentage points annually for 60 years. Aside from the huge costs, there has been virtually no contact between the two Koreas for decades, which have cut off almost all phone links and mail and did not have a formal meeting for about 20 years after the war. East Germans by comparison were able to see the outside world through West German TV and the two countries had far more exchanges of people. Recent polls show more than 60 percent of South Koreans want unification, but they would prefer it happen later rather than sooner because of the cost. About 70 percent of respondents see the North as a threat and few think it will give up its nuclear weapons any time soon. FACTORY PARK AND MOUNTAIN RESORT What little cooperation there has been in recent years between the Koreas has been confined to a mountain resort and a joint factory park located just north of the DMZ. The projects, complete with new road and rail links, were built by the South with the help of an affiliate of the Hyundai conglomerate and have seen their fortunes ebb and flow as ties between the two states have gone from warm to frigid. The DMZ is one of the most popular tourist sites in South Korea, attracting more than 600,000 visitors a year who see tank traps as they head toward the border and tunnels the North built under the zone decades ago to support an invasion. The highlight of most tours is the Panmunjom truce village that hosted the armistice talks and which sits within the DMZ. It is now home to uneasy staring matches between soldiers from the two Koreas as well as U.S. forces in the South. The actual border is called the Military Demarcation Line and is only an ankle-high strip of concrete in Panmunjom. In most of the DMZ, it is marked only by 1,290 yellow signs less than one square meter in size. If the DMZ ever comes down, South Korea wants to set up a nature preserve in the long strip, which has become a haven for wildlife including endangered species of birds, thousands of types of plants and 70 different mammals.

The five-member Appellate Division bench, headed by justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam, began hearing the arguments of attorney general Mahbubey Alam at around 9:45am. Alam argued against the defence plea of an 'army mutiny' at the previous day's hearing. "The Aug 15 killing in no way can be termed a mutiny. Even the convicts in their statements did not say it was a mutiny," he said. Before Alam, the chief state counsel in the case, Anisul Haque, delivered his arguments.

At least six relatives of four death convicts in the Sheikh Mujibur Rahman murder case, are among those arrested to date following the bomb attack on Taposh. Detective Branch police last week arrested Ataul Huda, another nephew of Huda, as a suspect in the same case. They arrested Shariful Haque Dalim's brother Quamrul Haque Swapan on Oct 19. Mohammed Nazmul Hassan Sohel and Mahbubul Hassan, sons of former Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed, were arrested on Oct 27. Others arrested in the case are Shafiullah Safu and Abdur Rahim, both said to be members of the Freedom Party. Taposh, a nephew of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, is involved with the legal team assisting the state counsels in the ongoing appeals of the death convicts in the Bangabandhu murder case. Senior Awami League figures, including the prime minister, have suggested the bomb attack was an attempt to "derail the Bangabandhu murder trial proceedings". Taposh, a ruling party MP, whose parents Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni and Arzoo Moni were murdered alongside Sheikh Mujib on Aug 15 1975, came under a bomb attack as he was leaving his Motijheel office by car on Oct 21. He was unhurt but 13 others, mostly bystanders, were injured by the blast. bdnews

<TITLE> World leaders line up to mark fall of Berlin Wall </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World leaders past and present will join German crowds on Monday to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall -- a stark symbol of the Cold War that divided a city and a continent. Recollections of November 9, 1989 dominated German newspaper headlines at the weekend, and television stations ran program after program of documentary footage, eyewitness accounts and discussion panels about the event that changed the face of Europe. "There has scarcely been an historical watershed so radical and so immediately visible as November 9, 1989," the Koelnische Rundschau daily wrote in an editorial. "Anyone standing shortly before eight at the Brandenburg Gate would have thought it an absurd dream that there would be a crowd of people on top of the Wall four hours later." Pivotal figures from the era that ushered in the collapse of communism in eastern Europe, such as ex-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Lech Walesa, who led anti-communist protests in Poland at the head of the Solidarity trade union, will take part in commemorative events around the once-divided capital on Monday. Joining them will be the leaders of the nations which occupied postwar Germany, apart from the United States, which will be represented by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev are all due to attend the celebrations hosted by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, amid a series of bilateral meetings. Thousands of tourists have poured into the capital to mark the event which hastened the reunification of Germany, the collapse of the Iron Curtain and the end of the Soviet Union. HAPPIEST DAY Merkel, who was working as a scientific researcher in East Berlin at the time, said this weekend the fall of the Wall was "the happiest day in recent Germany history." Celebrations are planned all over the city, including the toppling of 1,000 giant brightly colored dominoes along a 1.5 km (0.9 mile) stretch of the Wall's original path. Shaken by mass flight of its citizens into capitalist West Berlin, Communist East Germany began erecting its "anti-fascist protection barrier" in the early hours of August 13, 1961. According to a study published this year, at least 136 people were killed at the Berlin Wall between 1961 and 1989 while trying to escape. Thousands, however, managed to evade the minefields, dogs and guards in watchtowers, using ingenious schemes including tunnels, aerial wires and hidden compartments in cars in order to make it to the West. With some Germans, the 1990 reunification of the country remains a sore point. Several hundred leftist demonstrators on Saturday protested against the planned celebrations in Berlin. A new poll of over 1,000 Germans carried out for the Leipziger Volkszeitung daily showed one in eight wanted the Wall rebuilt -- with the numbers nearly equal in East and West. Survivors from the Cold War have been reflecting on the day when East Germany opened its border to the west after thousands of its citizens began slipping out from behind the Iron Curtain via Hungary's frontier with Austria in the summer of 1989. Helmut Schmidt, the 90-year-old former Chancellor who led West Germany from 1974 to 1982, told public broadcaster NDR he was "deeply moved" when the Wall fell. "I always knew we'd have the chance in Europe some day to reunite the two postwar German states, but I didn't think I'd live to see it," he said. "It almost overwhelmed

<TITLE> Tendulkar the greatest ever: Sangakkara </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com) -- Visiting Sri Lankan team skipper Kumar Sangakkara lavished praise on Sachin Tendulkar, who would be completing 20 years in international cricket on Nov 15, calling the Indian the "greatest player of the modern era", reports PTI. "He (Tendulkar) has been brilliant. To have survived the tough test of public expectation in India is something, which should be commended. The runs (he has scored) are an added bonus. He's probably the greatest player to play the game in the modern era and compares with the (Donald) Bradmans and all the legends of the past," Sangakkara said. "We run out of superlatives when talking about Sachin. He keeps getting better and better. Being that consistent under such pressure (from fans), especially at home is a wonderful thing," the Lankan captain and one-down batsman gushed. Asked about any game plan his team had in the upcoming three-Test rubber to contain the master batsman, Sangakkara gave a wry smile and said there can be plans and plans which may not work against Tendulkar who made his Test debut against Pakistan at Karachi on Nov 15, 1989. "A lot of people have game plan (for Tendulkar). We have to see what works. When a batsman is scoring runs and doing the way Sachin is doing he will be a threat to any team. It's nothing new. I have been answering this question over the years (whether he would be a threat). The answer is always yes," he said. Sangakkara said he and his teammates would do everything to break the jinx but the hosts would not be without any pressure either. "We have to wait and see how India comes out of this loss (against Australia), especially at home. We are under no pressure. We have not won a Test here before and we are here to change things. The pressure is on India to keep their home series record intact," Sangakkara said at a media conference after arriving in the wee hours on Sunday. "It's a great option to have three spinners with someone like Angelo Mathews who is bowling so well. He gives us that flexibility as a frontline fast bowler and batsman. It frees us one spot if the wicket shows us that three spinners are a possibility," Sangakkara said. However, he added, that on a regular basis his team went in with three fast bowlers and two spin bowlers. "Most often we like to play three fast bowlers and two spinners. The Angelo Mathews factor gives us the edge of having a proper all-rounder in the side," he explained. Sangakkara maintained that there was no mystery left in world cricket with the video analysis that's available today. "Words like mystery are exaggerated. You are a mystery only in your first series with the sort of video analysis available. You have to work harder later on," he said. Lankan mystery bowler Ajantha Mendis had troubled most of the top Indian batsmen when the last series between the two outfits was held in the Emerald Island. Sangakkara praised left-arm spinner Rangana Herath for the progress he has made recently, especially in the series at home against New Zealand and Pakistan where he outshone not only Mendis but also world record-setting wicket-taker Muttiah Muralitharan. "Herath is a great player. He's a positive guy who tries his heart out. Such a good spinner had to play third fiddle to Murali and Mendis which has made him hungrier. "Against New Zealand and Pakistan he out-bowled Murali and Mendis by a long way. He's a very important player and we hope he can replicate that performance," the Lanka captain said. Sangakkara said his team had two wicket-keeping options in number one Prasanna Jayawardene and Kaushal Silva and hoped his squad would settle down very soon ahead of the first Test in Ahmedabad commencing on November 16. "Kaushal Silva, who is understudy to Prasanna Jayawardene, has scored a huge amount of runs in domestic cricket. He gives us an extra option. But we have to settle down very soon into a winning combination before the Ahmedabad Test," he said. The Lankans are to open the tour with a three-day side game against the Board President"s XI at the MCA's Recreation Centre in the Bandra-Kurla Complex from Nov 11. They are scheduled to play the second and third Tests at Kanpur and Mumbai before clashing with the hosts in two T20 Internationals and a best-of-five ODI se

<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sunderland striker Darren Bent has been recalled to the England squad for next Saturday's friendly against Brazil in Qatar despite missing a penalty in front of England coach Fabio Capello on Saturday. Bent has been in excellent form since moving to Sunderland this season, scoring eight goals for his new side. However, he did miss a penalty when Sunderland lost 2-0 at his former club Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. Tottenham's Tom Huddlestone, who scored a blistering goal against Sunderland on Saturday, could win his first senior England cap. Aston Villa defender Stephen Warnock is also included and has the chance to add to the one cap he won as an 84th minute substitute when England played Trinidad & Tobago in Port of Spain in June last year. Capello has again omitted Michael Owen, even though forwards Emile Heskey and Carlton Cole are out with injuries and Owen's chances of playing in the World Cup finals next year now look slim. Other absentees include Steven Gerrard, Rio Ferdinand, Ashley Cole, Aaron Lennon and David James. They are all carrying injuries, apart from Cole who is playing his way back into the Chelsea side after an injury layoff. Squad Goalkeepers: Ben Foster (Manchester United), Robert Green (West Ham United), Joe Hart (Birmingham City). Defenders: Wayne Bridge (Manchester City), Wes Brown (Manchester United), Gary Cahill (Bolton Wanderers), Glen Johnson (Liverpool), Joleon Lescott (Manchester City), John Terry (Chelsea), Matthew Upson (West Ham United), Stephen Warnock (Aston Villa).

 LONDON, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham has pulled out of the England squad to face Brazil on Saturday after the midfielder's LA Galaxy club reached the MLS Western Conference final on Sunday. Beckham helped Galaxy to a 1-0 semi-final second leg win over Chivas USA to win the tie 3-2 on aggregate and reach the final against Houston Dynamo, which is scheduled for Friday. Beckham, though, was forced out of the match after 78 minutes after taking a knock to his lower back, and watched the remainder of the action with an ice-pack on the injury.

<TITLE> Strike continues as talks fail </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)River transport workers vowed to continue their indefinite strike on passenger, goods and fishing vessels as talks with the shipping ministry failed on Sunday. The strike, which began Saturday midnight, had paralysed river communications from morning. The Bangladesh River Transport Workers Federation, a coalition of worker unions, enforced the strike to press their 22-point demands, including a proper pay scale, effective application of riverine laws and a stop to harassment and robbery on river routes. Federation leaders were in talks with shipping secretary Abdul Mannan Hawlader through the afternoon. Mid-meeting, general secretary of the federation Chowdhury Ashiqul Alam emerged at arounf 7.30pm to tell reporters, "Talks with the government have failed. We'll continue our strike." He said discussion of their demands was still going on however. "The owners will be called in for a tri-lateral meeting if any positive decision is made today. But it will take much time, and the strike will go till then," Alam added. The ministry's public relations officer Jahangir Alam Khan, meanwhile, said the government has decided to form a committee, headed by a top labour ministry official, to prepare recommendations after reviewing the workers' demands, including pay issues. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at Sadarghat since Sunday morning, finding no launches leaving the capital's main river terminal, while goods piled up too. Launches bound for nearby destinations like Chandpur generally leave in the morning while those on the distant routes set out in the afternoon. Huge crowds scrambled to get a place on one of the few vessels leaving the terminal, the government-run 'Rocket' steamer that left for Khulna at 6pm. Thousands of other passengers were seen waiting through the day, expecting withdrawal of the strike. Motor launch MV Reaz's employee Asgar Hossain said they would not call off the strike until their demands were met. In Chittagong, port officials said unloading of ships at the outer-anchorage had been halted as lighter ships were not operating during the strike. Joint secretary of the Bangladesh River Transport Workers Federation Khorshed Alam told bdnews24.com, "No lighter ship has offloaded goods from the mother vessels since morning." Port authorities said some 48 ships have been waiting to unload. 'No untoward incidents' Dhaka Kotwali police chief Md Salahuddin told bdnews24.com no untoward incidents occurred through the day, though "a faction" of workers demonstrated in defiance of the strikers. Pro-ruling party Bangladesh River Transport Workers League marched Sunday afternoon in protest against the strike, he said. "But police patrol has been tightened. There is no possibility of deterioration of law and order here," he added. bdnews

<TITLE> Netanyahu's Washington trip clouded by Abbas threat </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEL AVIV, Israel, Nov 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flew to Washington on Sunday with the US Middle East peace drive in crisis over a threat by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to stand down. Though Abbas's potential departure could mean the loss of a pivotal partner for Middle East peace talks, US President Barack Obama has not said whether he will hold talks with Netanyahu while he is in Washington. Spokesmen for Netanyahu said the main reason for his four-day trip, which will include a Paris stopover for talks with France's President Nicolas Sarkozy, was a speech on Monday to a forum of North American Jewish leaders in Washington. Efforts were being made to arrange a meeting with Obama as well, though the White House had yet to confirm it, they said. Israeli commentators say no invitation to see Obama would amount to an embarrassing snub by Israel's largest ally. Netanyahu aide Nir Hefetz rejected any suggestion of a chill in ties with Washington over obstacles in the way of Obama's goal of renewing peace talks, stalled since the Gaza war. "It takes time to build personal relations, and I believe we are on the way to doing so," Hefetz said on Israel Radio. Netanyahu has declined to comment on Abbas's announcement he will not stand in elections scheduled for January 24 -- a move that could keep peace talks on hold for months to come. "NOT EXCITED" A moderate supported by the West, Abbas accused Washington of retreating from its demand for a freeze on Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank before peace talks resume. Israeli officials say Netanyahu wants to avoid interfering in Palestinian politics. But some commentators say the right-wing Israeli may be deliberately ignoring Abbas's threat, seeing it as just another bid to press Israel to halt settlement construction. Netanyahu insists he needs to accommodate the needs of growing families in Israeli enclaves in the West Bank but has said Israel will avoid constructing any additional settlements. Since taking office in March, he has repeatedly accused Abbas of delaying peace talks and setting new conditions. He has also introduced a new Israeli demand that the Palestinians recognize Israel "as a Jewish state." Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, himself a settler heading an ultranationalist party, said he did not take Abbas's threat seriously. "You could call it an exercise, or a threat," Lieberman said. "You can interpret it as you wish, but I wouldn't get very excited about it." Israeli President Shimon Peres, a Nobel peace laureate for his role in the first Israeli-Palestinian interim accord in 1993, has been virtually alone in urging Abbas to stay on. Addressing tens of thousands at a candlelit memorial for assassinated Israeli leader Yitzhak Rabin, Peres spoke of Abbas, saying: "I say to him as a colleague -- do not let

 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)The attorney general capped his arguments on Monday at the hearing of death appeals at the Supreme Court in the Bangabandhu murder case. The five-member Appellate Division bench, headed by justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam, began hearing arguments for the 26th day at around 9:45am. It ended at around 1:45pm. Another state counsel Toufique Newaz will begin his arguments on Tuesday. After the prosecution is done with its arguments, the defence counsels will get their turn to reply to the arguments. The hearing focuses on the five points, based on which the Appellate Division had granted the appeal petition. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam argued against the defence plea of an 'army mutiny' at the previous day's hearing. "The Aug 15 killing in no way can be termed a mutiny. Even the convicts in their statements did not say it was a mutiny," he had said. Before Alam, the chief state counsel in the case, Anisul Haque, delivered his arguments. The prosecution started its arguments on Nov 2. On Oct 5, the newly formed bench began hearing the appeals against previous court sentences to hang some convicts in the case for assassinating the nation's founding leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. bdne

<TITLE> Nobel winner, Soviet H-bomb scientist Ginzburg dies </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Nov 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Vitaly Ginzburg, a Russian physicist who survived Stalin's purges by working on the Soviet atomic bomb project and later won the Nobel Prize for physics, died in Moscow late on Sunday after a long illness. He was 93. Ginzburg won the 2003 Nobel physics prize for developing the theory behind superconductors, materials which allow electricity to pass without resistance at very low temperatures. He shared the prize with British-American Anthony Leggett and Russian-born US scientist Alexei Abrikosov. But Ginzburg's career as a Soviet scientist almost ended when he took as his second wife a woman arrested in 1944 and sentenced to three years in labour camps for supposedly plotting against Stalin's life. State anti-Semitism was flourishing and an attack on Ginzburg was published in a journal. "I can only guess what fate awaited me in this situation at this time," Ginzburg wrote in an autobiographical article written for the Nobel prize committee. "I think that it would have cost me dear but I was saved by the hydrogen bomb." Ginzburg wrote that he worked together with fellow Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov -- later a famous dissident -- on the Soviet H-bomb project and said they developed the two key ideas which made it possible to create the device. But in 1951, Ginzburg was dismissed from the atom bomb project as Stalin led a fresh campaign of anti-Semitism which aimed to blame Jews for the Soviet Union's problems and exile them into labour camps. "It was a tremendous luck that the Great Leader did not have enough time to carry out what he had planned to do and died, or was killed, on 5th March 1953," Ginzburg wrote in the article. He said he and his second wife Nina Yermakova had celebrated the day of Stalin's death ever since as a "great festival". Ginzburg was active in public life after the demise of the Soviet Union, signing letters and giving interviews hitting out at official indifference to fundamental science in modern Russia. He attacked the Kremlin's growing links with the Orthodox church and urged Western Europe to stop then-President Vladimir Putin returning to "a totalitarian past". "We hope that the governments of democratic countries will do all they can to prevent Russia sliding into the totalitarian past and the establishment of a dictatorial regime dangerous for Russia and for all international society," said the appeal he signed in November 2005. SCIENCE FOR PROFIT In May 2007 Ginzburg said in an interview that the pursuit of science in Putin's Russia was driven by profit alone and that government interference today was in some ways worse than under Stalin. "Of course, in Stalin's times the Academy was under the control of the central committee of the Communist Party," Ginzburg told Britain's Sunday Telegraph newspaper. "But in those days you could come up with an idea and create -- that's how we put the first Sputnik satellite into space. Now the government thinks science must bring only income and profit, which is absurd." A convinced atheist and secular Jew, Ginzburg was among Russian scientists who signed an open letter to Putin in July 2007 warning that the Orthodox church's growing influence in Russia threatened to erode the separation of church and state and upset other officially recognised religions. Ginzburg was born in Moscow on October 4, 1916 to a doctor mother who died of typhoid in 1920 and an engineer father. Ginzburg's first marriage was to a fellow student, Olga Zamsha, in 1937. The couple divorced nine years later after having a daughter, who also became a physicist. Briefly summing up his long and eventful life in a television interview, Ginzburg said with a smile: "If I believed in God, I would start every morning by saying, 'Thank you, My Lord, for making me a theoretical physicist.&

<TITLE> Healthcare measure faces tough path in Senate </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - After a landmark win in the House of Representatives, President Barack Obama's push for healthcare reform faces a difficult path in the Senate amid divisions in his own Democratic Party on how to proceed. On a 220-215 vote, including the support of one Republican and opposition from 39 Democrats, the House backed a bill late on Saturday that would expand coverage to nearly all Americans and bar insurance practices such as refusing to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions. The battle now shifts to the Senate, where work on Obama's top domestic priority has been stalled for weeks as Democratic leader Harry Reid searches for an approach that can win the 60 votes he needs to overcome Republican procedural hurdles. "Take this baton and bring this effort to the finish line," Obama urged senators on Sunday in an appearance at the White House, saying passage of healthcare reform would represent "their finest moment in public service." Democrats have no margin for error -- they control exactly 60 seats in the 100-member Senate. Some moderate Democrats have rebelled at Reid's plan to include a new government-run insurance program, known as the "public option," in the bill. Senator Joe Lieberman, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, renewed his promise on Sunday to help Republicans block a final vote if the bill contains the government-run insurance option backed by Senate liberals. "If the public option plan is in there, as a matter of conscience, I will not allow this bill to come to a final vote," Lieberman said on "Fox News Sunday." Republicans and some moderate Democrats have balked at the House bill's $1 trillion price tag, new taxes on the wealthy and what they call a heavy-handed government intrusion in the private sector. The overhaul would lead to the biggest changes in the $2.5 trillion healthcare system -- which accounts for one-sixth of the U.S. economy -- since the 1965 creation of the Medicare government health insurance program for the elderly. DIFFERENT APPROACHES The House bill includes a different version of the public option than the Senate. Senate Democrats also may not adopt the House bill's requirement that all but the smallest employers offer coverage to their workers and its new tax on the wealthiest Americans to pay for the reforms. Eventually, the House and Senate would have to reconcile their differences and agree on one bill to be passed again and sent to Obama for his signature. "The House bill is dead on arrival in the Senate," Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on CBS's "Face the Nation," calling it "a bill written by liberals for liberals." The House bill would set up exchanges where people could choose to purchase private insurance or a government-run option bitterly opposed by the insurance industry. It also would offer subsidies to help low-income Americans buy insurance. Congressional budget analysts say it would extend coverage to 36 million uninsured people living in the United States, covering about 96 percent of the population, and would reduce the budget deficit by about $100 billion over 10 years. The House vote was a vital victory for Obama, who staked much of his political capital on the healthcare battle. A loss in the House could have ended the fight, impaired the rest of his legislative agenda and left Democrats vulnerable to big losses in next year's congressional elections. Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2008 and a leader of conservative grass-roots opposition to Obama's agenda, promised retribution in those elections against healthcare reform advocates. "It's on to the Senate now. Our legislators can listen now, or they can hear us in 2010. It's their choice," Palin said on her Facebook page, promising: "We will make our voices heard." Reid has been awaiting cost estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office before unveiling a Senate bill, and has indicated Obama's goal of signing a bill by Christmas could slip to 2010. Reid said he hoped to receive those cost estimates in the coming days, and that he planned to bring a final bill to the Senate floor for consideration "as soon as possi

<TITLE> China's Wen to boost aid to Africa as ties blossom </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao offered Africa $10 billion in concessional loans over the next three years on Sunday, saying China was a "true and trusted friend" of the continent and its people. The aid offer is double that unveiled by President Hu Jintao at the last summit in Beijing in 2006, as China aims to boost a relationship which politically goes back decades and is now economically booming, to the discomfort of some in the West. Wen brushed aside concerns that China was only interested in Africa's natural resources to help feed its booming economy. "China's support for Africa's development is real and solid and, in the future, no matter what turbulence the world undergoes, our friendship with the people of Africa will not change," he told a summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. Besides the loans, Wen said China would help Africa develop clean energy and cope with climate change, encourage Chinese financial institutions to lend to smaller African firms and expand market access for African products. He also called for greater international help for the continent. "Africa's development is an essential part of achieving global development, and as the sincere and dependable friend of Africa, China deeply feels the difficulties and challenges faced by Africa," We said. "China calls on the international community to enhance its sense of urgency, and support Africa's development in an even truer and more effective way." LONG FRIENDSHIP Blossoming trade and business ties have attracted Western criticism that Beijing is only interested in African resources, while Chinese commentators respond that envious Europeans still treat the continent like a colony. China's friendship with Africa dates from the 1950s, when Beijing backed liberation movements fighting colonial rule. Trade has risen sharply in the past decade, driven by China's hunger for resources to power its economic boom and African demand for cheap Chinese products. Still, this has not been without its critics, who say China is only interested in African resources and supports governments with dubious human rights records as a means to get them. The summit was attended by the presidents of Zimbabwe and Sudan, two countries often under fire for their rights records. Wen repeated that China would not interfere in the internal politics of any African country. "The Chinese government and people have always respected the autonomous right of the African people to choose their own social systems. China's support and aid for Africa has never and will never attach any political conditions." Some Chinese commentators have not been so diplomatic in the days running up to the summit, saying the West still views Africa as though it were a colony. "The West is envious of China and Africa drawing closer," popular Chinese tabloid the Global Times, published by Communist Party mouthpiece the People's Daily, wrote on Tuesday. "Europeans view Africa as their own backyard," the newspaper quoted Chinese Africa expert Xu Weizhong as saying. "Of course they feel uncomfortable about the arrival of the Chinese." Some Africans welcome how China's approach differs from that of Europe or the United States. "China's policy is based on mutual development. Few Western countries have a foreign policy like this -- most are about telling Africans what to do," said Kwaku Atuahene-Gima, executive director of the Africa programme at the China Europe International Business School in Shang

<TITLE> Chelsea beat Man U to go 5 points clear </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Captain John Terry headed Chelsea five points clear at the top of the Premier League on Sunday when his 76th-minute goal secured a 1-0 home victory over champions Manchester United. The eagerly-awaited showdown had been meandering towards a disappointing goalless draw until Terry was left unmarked to glance in a Frank Lampard freekick -- with striker Nicolas Anelka claiming he got the final touch. The victory took Chelsea to 30 points, five clear of Arsenal, who won 4-1 at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday, and United. Tottenham Hotspur are fourth on 22 after they beat Sunderland 2-0 on Saturday. Liverpool host Birmingham City on Monday. Earlier on Sunday, Hull City beat visitors Stoke City 2-1 with a stoppage-time goal, Everton won 2-1 at West Ham United while Wigan Athletic drew 1-1 at home to Fulham. However, all eyes were on Stamford Bridge this weekend, even though for the most part the big game failed to deliver

<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  Ministers have called for patience regarding the launch of war crimes trials as the government is presses ahead with work. State minister for housing and public works, Abdul Mannan Khan, and state minister for law, Kamrul Islam, visited the building at 14 Abdul Gani Road on Sunday, where a special war crimes tribunal will be set up. Mannan, asked by reporters why trials had not yet begun almost one year into the present government's tenure, said: "The nation will have to have more patience. We have to be given time. We are not idling  we are progressing with our work." Currently, three administrative appeals tribunals and an office are housed in the building at 14 Abdul Gani Road. Mannan told the reporters that orders have been given to move these offices to Janata Tower in Kawran Bazar. "However, it will take about two months to relocate and make those offices fully operational again." Kamrul Islam said the government is gradually advancing towards the trials. "We have made much progress already. A budget has been allocated and passed in parliament. We are collecting information and evidence on war criminals." "When we are ready, we will reveal who are to be tried, who will prosecute and who will be the judges," said Islam. One of the Awami League's top election pledges was the long-awaited trial of 1971 war crimes. Several government ministers have given a series of dates in recent months for formation of investigative bodies, prosecution cells and tribunal. But these are yet to be announced. b

<TITLE> Clinton star power flickers in diplomatic arena </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Analysis By Andrew Quinn WASHINGTON, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hillary Clinton may be one of the brightest lights in the Obama White House, but a turbulent week shows that star power alone cannot solve the world's toughest problems. When Clinton took the job as President Barack Obama's top diplomat, some analysts said she might be too big for the State Department. In the public eye for decades as political wife, U.S. first lady, senator and finally presidential candidate, Clinton's career has won her admirers at home and abroad, making her one of the brightest stars in the Obama administration. But after a turbulent tour of diplomatic trouble spots this week, it is clear that Clinton's star power alone cannot solve some of the world's intractable problems. "The administration has a host of major problems in the region, running from Pakistan in the east to Israel in the west, yet none of these issues has become a signature issue for her," Jon Alterman, a Middle East specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an email message. "She did what she had to do over the weekend, but it wasn't entirely clear that her heart was in it." Clinton had two objectives on her 9-day trip to Pakistan and the Middle East: repair the fraying U.S. relationship with Islamabad, and build support to relaunch peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians. Neither was a slam dunk, although U.S. officials said hopefully they saw some signs of progress on both fronts after days of Clinton's hectic personal diplomacy. Asked at a Cairo news conference to weigh the trip's achievements against its disappointments, Clinton herself showed no hint of doubt. "Of course I think I made advancements," she said. "Every issue that we touched during the trip is complicated and difficult. If these were easy questions with simple answers, I would not have made this trip." GOOD INTENTIONS ARE NOT ENOUGH In Pakistan, Clinton struggled to persuade skeptical audiences that Washington, which many Pakistanis blame for their country's costly struggle against religious insurgents, was a reliable long-term partner. "Good intentions are not enough in fixing a relationship that historically has been flawed," said Shuja Nawaz, a Pakistan expert who directs the South Asia Center at the Atlantic Council in Washington. Clinton won praise for speaking candidly about a relationship complicated by widespread Pakistani anger over conditions attached to a massive new U.S. aid bill. But a barrage of hostile questions from students, tribal leaders and women's groups thrown at her illustrated the depth of distrust many in the fragile, nuclear-armed state still feel toward the United States. "If Washington is ever to enlist Pakistan as a reliable ally, it's going to have to do a much better job of explaining itself," a New York Times editorial said. "Mrs. Clinton's trip was an important start -- but only a start." ALL ABOUT DAMAGE CONTROL The Mideast phase of Clinton's trip produced even fewer tangible results. Seeking to build pressure to resume stalled peace talks, Clinton infuriated Arabs by endorsing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's offer to "restrain" Israeli settlement activity on the West Bank -- but not to freeze it as Palestinians demand. The remainder of the trip was about damage control as Clinton tried to persuade Arab foreign ministers and the media that U.S. opposition to settlements had not really changed. U.S. officials say Washington wants the Palestinians to follow Israel by dropping preconditions for talks and begin formal negotiations where all issues, including settlements, borders and the future of Jerusalem, can be addressed. "Their ability to advance their position increases dramatically when they are at the table," one senior U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the discussion. But the outrage over the U.S. shift of emphasis on settlements showed that even a politician as accomplished as Clinton can err in the maze of Middle East peace discussions. U.S. officials said Clinton continues to work toward resumed peace talks, although they concede that it may require the biggest star, Obama himself, to seal the deal. "The president has the biggest gun. And it can be deployed effectively at the right time," one official s

<TITLE> Study shows high cost of German reunification: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - As Germany prepares to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, a new study shows that some 1.3 trillion euros ($1.9 trillion) have been transferred from the west to rebuild the east, a newspaper reported on Saturday. The report by the Halle-based IWH research institute showed the net transfers from west to east -- a sum equivalent to over half Germany's total economic output in 2008 -- had "risen significantly" in the past decade, weekly Welt am Sonntag said. Monday will be the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Wall, which the once-divided city will mark by toppling 1,000 brightly colored dominoes that were being erected on Saturday along a 1.5 kilometer stretch of the Cold War barrier's original path. The east has cast off many shackles from its Communist past, thanks partly to the transfers, but unemployment remains nearly double that of the west and economists say it is still years away from catching up with the richer part of the country. The unpublished IWH report was originally commissioned by the government in 2006 but the finance ministry later withdrew its name from the project because of differences of opinion about how the figures were calculated, the newspaper said. The Cologne-based IW economic research institute said this week eastern output per capita would rise to around 80 percent of western levels from 70 percent now over the next decade. Eastern output was around 33 percent of the west in 1991. German Chancellor Angela Merkel will meet world leaders past and present to mark the historic event on Monday, when speeches are due be held in Berlin by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, among others. In her weekly podcast, Merkel, who was working as a scientific researcher in east Berlin at the time, said the fall of the Wall was the "the happiest day in recent Germany history." She added she went off to the sauna "as usual on Thursdays" when she heard the East-West border was about to open, an event which proved a watershed in 20th Century hist

<TITLE> Thousands in West Bank urge Abbas not to quit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HEBRON, West Bank, Nov 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of Palestinians turned out in Hebron on Sunday to urge Mahmoud Abbas to run again for the presidency following his announcement that he did not want a second term in the job. Waving flags, Abbas supporters lined the streets of Hebron to greet the president as he conducted a rare tour of towns in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, part of the territories where the Palestinians aim to establish a state. "Mahmoud Abbas, don't step down! You are the foundation," chanted the crowd. The scenes were broadcast live on official Palestine television, which has been airing programs in support of Abbas since his declaration on Thursday that he did not want to run in the election he recently scheduled for January 24. Abbas, who opened a cultural center in Hebron, was due to give a speech in Bethlehem at 4.30 p.m. (9:30 a.m. EST). Many analysts believe his announcement could be a tactic to prompt the United States to put more pressure on Israel to halt all West Bank settlement building. But chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat reiterated on Sunday that Abbas's announcement was a not a tactic. Abbas has built his political career around negotiating a peace deal with Israel. He voiced disappointment in his speech last Thursday with what he described as the United States "favoring" Israel in arguments over re-launching peace talks. The Palestine Liberation Organization, which Abbas also heads, has rejected his announcement, urging him to stay on. Abbas, 74, replaced the late Yasser Arafat as president five years ago. His call for presidential and legislative elections has been rejected by the Islamist group Hamas, which seized control of the Gaza Strip in 2007 and contests his legitimacy. Given Hamas's decision to ban the election in the Gaza Strip, many analysts doubt whether the poll will go ahead at all, and if it did it would lack legitimacy, they

 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com) -- The USA Cricket Association has again stated its desire to stage international matches in the wake of comments from an Indian government official that the US could be an ideal place to stage India against Pakistan games, reports Cricinfo. "We are keen to have both the top teams of the subcontinent and we welcome India's proposal in this regard," said Nabeel Ahmad, USACA's senior vice-president, told AAP. "It's a very good proposal because everyone related to cricket wants Pakistan and India to resume their cricket as such events are always thrilling and entertaining." Critics have claimed that USACA needs to walk before it can run, adding that it has no experience of hosting major cricket. "We have an 8,000-capacity ICC-approved stadium in Florida which can accommodate nearly 25,000 spectators with makeshift arrangements by erecting extra stands," Ahmed countered. "Cricket is gaining rapid popularity in the US, specially Twenty20 cricket, and the youth is taking keen interest in it," he said. "More and more players are joining the game and we see a bright cricket future in the US because [the] market is full of sponsors. We plan to build more international cricket stadiums with the passage of time in other parts of the US. "We are capable of hosting a full-fledged series.

 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)River transport workers continued their countrywide indefinite strike on Monday as talks with the shipping ministry in realising their demands failed the previous day. bdnews24.com correspondent reported only one vessel reached Sadarghat terminal in Dhaka early morning that had set out from Bhola prior to the start of the strike enforced Saturday midnight. Bangladesh River Transport Workers Federation, a coalition of workers unions, enforced the strike to press home their 22-point demands, including a reasonable pay scale, effective application of riverine laws and curbing harassment and robbery on the river routes. Federation leaders were in talks with shipping secretary Abdul Mannan Hawlader through Sunday afternoon. Chowdhury Ashiqul Alam, general secretary of the federation, told reporters: "Talks with the government have failed. We'll continue our strike." The ministry's public relations officer, Jahangir Alam Khan, meanwhile, said the government had decided to form a committee, headed by a top labour ministry official, to prepare recommendations after reviewing the workers' demands, including pay issues. The strike paralysed river communication causing trouble to thousands of passengers and disrupting transportation of goods.

<TEXT>
 Meherpur, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  Police have arrested another nephew of Bazlul Huda, a death convict in the Bangabandhu murder case, in connection with the Oct 21 bomb attack on MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh. Investigation officer and assistant commissioner of the Detective Branch Md Akbar Hossain told bdnews24.com Habibur Azim Habib, 36, was detained from his house in Meherpur early on Sunday. He was to be taken to Dhaka, said police. Officer in charge of Meherpur Sadar Police Station Rabiul Islam said he was detained "at the order of higher authorities". Habib is the son of Anwarul Huda, Bazlul Huda's cousin. While detained at the police station, Habib claimed there was no case against him and he did not know why police had detained him. His wife Halima Khatun told journalists Habib returned from Malaysia two years ago after working there for many years. She said he now ran a fish farming business in Ujalpur village of Meherpur Sadar upazila. Detective Branch police last week arrested Ataul Huda, another nephew of Bazlul Huda, in connection to the same case. At least six relatives of four death convicts in the Sheikh Mujibur Rahman murder case, are among those arrested to date following the bomb attack case filed by Taposh. Police arrested Shariful Haque Dalim's brother Quamrul Haque Swapan on Oct 19. They arrested Khandaker Mehnaz Rashid, daughter of fugitive death convict Lt Col Abdur Rashid's on Oct 24. Mohammed Nazmul Hassan Sohel and Mahbubul Hassan, sons of former Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed, were arrested on Oct 27. Others arrested in the case are Shafiullah Safu and Abdur Rahim, both said to be members of the Freedom Party. Taposh, a nephew of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, is involved with the legal team assisting the state counsels in the ongoing appeals of the death convicts in the Bangabandhu murder case. Senior Awami League figures, including the prime minister, have suggested the bomb attack was an attempt to "derail the Bangabandhu murder trial proceedings". Taposh, a ruling party MP, whose parents Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni and Arzoo Moni were murdered alongside Sheikh Mujib on Aug 15 1975, came under a bomb attack as he was leaving his Motijheel office by car on Oct 21. He was unhurt but 13 others, mostly bystanders, were injured by the blast. bdnews24.c

<TITLE> G20 pledge to support economy until recovery firms </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ST ANDREWS, Scotland, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers pledged on Saturday to prepare strategies to end emergency support for their economies, but to keep the aid flowing until recovery was assured. The world's biggest economies -- the European Union, the United States and Japan -- are either expected to or already have emerged from recession in the third quarter. This has prompted a discussion on when to start cutting back on the trillions in public support pledged to cushion the worst economic downturn since World War Two to maintain credibility of fiscal policies with markets and consumers. Officials from the world's 20 biggest developed and emerging economies said at the end of talks in the small Scottish town of St. Andrews that while the economy has improved, recovery was still uneven and depended on policy support. "While we will continue to provide support for the economy until the recovery is secured, we also commit to develop further strategies for managing the withdrawal from our extraordinary macroeconomic and financial support measures," they said. But some central banks like the European Central Bank have already taken their first steps towards the exit from crisis liquidity support and ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said on Saturday the US Federal Reserve had similar plans. "We had an occasion to tell what was our understanding of the progressive phasing-out of the non-conventional measures that have been decided on both sides of the Atlantic, but also by other central banks," Trichet told a news conference. "It appears also that on the other side of the Atlantic the same kind of progressive, gradual phasing out of non- conventional measures is envisaged," he said. Other central banks would follow at the right time, he said. "All of us, to my knowledge, have said that when needed, and where needed, there would be the phasing out of unconventional measures in a timely and gradual fashion ... All central banks, and certainly the ECB, are doing all that is necessary, but no more than is necessary," he said. PACEMAKER While the ECB last Thursday would not dispel market expectations that it would drop its one-year liquidity operations next year, the Bank of England extended its quantitative easing programme, although at a slower pace. European countries, encouraged by positive growth forecasts for the next two years, are considering 2011 as the deadline for launching deep deficit cuts to bring public finances back under control and head off huge debts for future generations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner made clear it was too early to remove public support for the economy even though the focus has shifted together with the recovering growth. "It is too early to start to lean against recovery," Geithner told a news conference. "If we put the brakes on too quickly we will weaken the economy and the financial system... and the ultimate cost of the crisis will be greater." "With growth now underway and the financial fires winding down, the policy challenge is changing. The first stage was the emergency rescue. The next stage was catalysing private demand and business investment. This will require continued policy support," he said. The Federal Reserve has pledged to keep interest rates extraordinarily low for "an extended period" and most analysts expect it to hold rates near zero until mid-2010 or later. But some US emergency liquidity facilities, such as a commercial paper funding facility, are winding down as markets improve. On Oct. 29, the $300 billion Treasury programme ended, and Fed purchases of agency mortgage-related debt are due to be phased out by the end of March. In November, the Fed said it would buy $175 billion of agency notes, lower than its original intention of up to $200 billi

<TEXT>
 Prokash Biswas bdnews24.com court correspondent Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)Long-awaited security cameras that finally began surveillance at Dhaka courts at the end of last month are already delivering benefits, an official said on Saturday. The decision to set up closed circuit television cameras as a security measure in the trial courts was first made following the Aug 17 2005 countrywide serial bombings by militants. But they took more than four years to set up. Eight CCTV cameras were finally installed on Oct 27 this year to monitor the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court and Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court. All entry points of the two prison cells at the two court premises can now be monitored from a control room on the ground floor of the CMM court premises, which is used as the headquarters of the criminal prosecution division of metropolitan police. Ruhul Amin, deputy commissioner of police at the prosecution division, and in charge of the control room, told bdnews24.com, "We are already seeing the benefits of the cameras." "The number of touts and troublemakers loitering on the court premises has dropped significantly and illegal transaction of money has waned simultaneously." On an average, 700 prisoners produced before the court each day, from Dhaka Central Jail and Kashimpur Jail, can be monitored through the cameras, said Amin. The cameras operate on all holidays including weekends Friday and Saturday. Each camera covers a range of 30 feet and is equipped with night vision. Recorded images remained on tape for 10 days, he added. Amin said 22 more closed circuit cameras would be installed on court premises "very soon." Shakhawat Hossain, proprietor of Nirapatta Services Ltd, supplier of the cameras, said, "US-based company Avtek manufactured the camera parts that were later assembled in Taiwan." b

<TITLE> ULFA leaders 'detained in Dhaka' produced in Indian court </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 by bdnews24.com New Delhi Correspondent New Delhi, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)Police in India's northeastern state of Assam produced two top leaders of the banned separatist outfit ULFA in a Guwahati court on Saturday. The Chief Judicial Magistrate in Guwahati sent the duo to 10 days police custody after they were produced in his court on Saturday. ULFA has alleged that its 'finance secretary' Chitrabon Hazarika and 'foreign secretary' Shashadhar Choudhury had been picked up by "unidentified armed men" from a house in Dhaka, Bangladesh, sometime between Nov 1 night and Nov 2 morning. The outfit has called for a dawn-to-dusk general shutdown across the state of Assam on Monday (Nov 9) to protest against the detention of its leaders. In a statement e-mailed to the press, the ULFA chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa alleged that the detention of Hazarika and Choudhury from Dhaka was part of the Indian government's "conspiracy" to neutralise the organisation's leaders. The organisation has also protested their "handover to Indian authorities" though Bangladesh has no extradition treaty with India. Neither the Indian government in New Delhi nor the state government in Assam has made any official statement on how the two top rebel leaders landed in the custody of Indian police. Sources in India's home ministry, however, speaking to bdnews24.com in New Delhi, said that Hazarika and Choudhury had been spotted by Border Security Force personnel at the Bangladesh-India border at Gokul Nagar in Tripura. "They were trying to cross over to India from Bangladesh, when the BSF personnel spotted them and asked them to surrender. They surrendered and were taken into custody," an official of the Indian government's ministry of home affairs said on condition of anonymity. He added that the two ULFA leaders had later been taken to Guwahati. The Indian government and security agencies have long alleged that ULFA and other insurgent groups operating in the country's northeastern states have bases in Bangladesh. They claim that ULFA chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa, 'military chief' Paresh Barua and other leaders remote-control the outfit's subversive activities in Assam from Dhaka and other cities in Bangladesh. They have, however, acknowledged that Sheikh Hasina's government, coming to power in January this year, has come down heavily on ULFA leaders and their activities in Bangladesh, booking them in cases such as the 2004 Chittagong 'ten truck arms' haul. The Indian government's ministry of external affairs has not yet made any formal statement on the detention of Hazarika and Choudhury. But, according to sources, New Delhi perceives the Bangladesh government's "cooperation" in detaining the duo as "a good gesture" by Dhaka ahead of prime minister Sheikh Hasina's upcoming visit to India. The ULFA or the United Liberation Front of Assam has been pursuing an armed rebellion since 1979 against what it terms New Delhi's "colonial rule" over the oil-rich tea-growing northeastern state. The outfit had several camps in Bhutan too. But, in 2003, Bhutan launched a military offensive against them, dismantled its camps and detained a number of its leaders and guerrillas along with a large number of arms and huge quantity of ammunition. The Bhutanese authorities later handed over the detained insurgents to Indian security forces, although the ULFA alleged that some of its leaders and activists had been killed even after they had surrendered. ULFA later regrouped and continued its violent insurgency in the state including bombings. But it suffered a split last year, when some of its leaders declared a unilateral cease-fire agreement with the Indian government. New Delhi reciprocated, halting the security forces offensive against the outfit. The ULFA's top leaders, including Rajkhowa and Barua, however, dissociated themselves from the peace-process and vowed to continue the "armed struggle to liberate Assam from Indian rule". In March 2008, Mohammed Hafijur Rehman and Din Mohammed, both prime accused in the Chittagong arms haul case, confessed in court that a 10 truck-load consignment of weapons and ammunition, seized in the port city of Bangladesh in 2004, had in fact been meant for the ULFA. Rehman also revealed that the ULFA military chief Barua himself had supervised the arms-smuggling operation. During foreign minister Dipu Moni's visit to New Delhi last September, India and Bangladesh had reiterated their resolve to strengthen bilateral co-operation to deter terrorist activities. In a joint statement, both sides also reiterated their resolve not to allow the use of their territories for activities inimical to each other's security interests. Sources in the Indian ministry of home affairs, meanwhile, have said that interrogation of Choudhury and Hazarika might provide significant insights into the financing and international operations of ULFA, which investigators believe have in recent years become linked with global arms smuggling cartels.

<TITLE> Iran atomic negotiator says wants speedy talks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Nov 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's chief negotiator in talks with Western powers over its atomic programme said on Sunday he hoped a draft deal on nuclear fuel would be reached soon. "Tehran still welcomes the negotiations (with the six powers) on the basis of its package of proposals," state broadcaster IRIB quoted Saeed Jalili as saying. It said he hoped the talks "will be completed as quickly as possible". The United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China want to persuade Iran to suspend uranium enrichment activities in return for economic and political incentives. Tehran has so far refused to halt its enrichment. A UN-drafted nuclear proposal would see Iran sending most of its low-enriched uranium abroad by the end of the year for further enrichment before being returned to Iran as fuel for a medical reactor in Tehran. Iran says talks are needed on the nuclear deal and that wants to import atomic fuel rather than send its own uranium abroad for processing. The West accuses Iran of covertly trying to build a nuclear bomb. Tehran says its nuclear programme is peaceful, aimed at generating electricity to meet its booming domestic dem

<TITLE> CDC says US making progress on swine flu vaccine </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CHICAGO, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US health officials said on Friday they are making progress in improving the supply of H1N1 vaccine to state health departments and urged people frustrated by long lines and scarce supply not to give up. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Dr. Anne Schuchat said there are now twice as many doses of vaccine available as there were two weeks ago, with 38 million doses ordered or available for ordering by states. The figure is still below the government's earlier estimate of 40 million doses available by the end of October, but Schuchat said the pace of progress is improving. "Today's number is up more than 11 million doses from last Friday's amount. That is progress. If all goes well, we're expecting about 8 million doses to be available in the week ahead," Schuchat told a news briefing. The US government initially projected that 20 million doses would roll out every week, but companies manufacturing them are producing only about 10 million doses a week or fewer, depending on when batches are ready. The shortage of H1N1 vaccines has heaped pressure on public health departments across the country that must dole out the scare vaccine to groups at the highest risk from swine flu. Children and young people under age 24, pregnant women, healthcare workers and people with underlying health conditions are supposed to get the shots first. The United States buys both seasonal and H1N1 vaccine from five makers -- GlaxoSmithKline Plc, AstraZeneca Plc's MedImmune unit, Novartis, Sanofi-Aventis, and CSL Limited. Robert Blendon of the Harvard School of Public Health and colleagues found that only 5 percent of Americans they polled have been vaccinated against H1N1 so far. LOW PERCENTAGE VACCINATED Their nationally representative survey of 1,073 adults found that 17 percent of all adults and 41 percent of parents had tried to be vaccinated. But just 21 percent of high-priority adults, such as asthma patients, have tried to be vaccinated. Of those who tried to get an H1N1 vaccine, 30 percent succeeded. "We still don't have enough vaccine. We know that communities are seeing lots of demand and the supply has hasn't caught up with that. We do need more, but we think we're moving toward a path of improvement at this point," Schuchat said. The pandemic H1N1 virus has infected millions globally, with more than 5,000 documented deaths, including more than 1,000 Americans. Schuchat said swine flu is still widespread in 48 states and she does not believe the pandemic has reached its peak, noting that flu season can last through May. "Most of the illness we are seeing is in younger people," she said. The latest count shows 129 children have been killed by the virus in the United States since April, up from 114 a week ago. Two thirds of those deaths have been in people with underlying conditions such as cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy and asthma. On Thursday, New York City health officials scrambled to explain themselves in the wake of media reports that bankers got scarce H1N1 flu vaccines at work. Schuchat said state and local health departments are best placed to make the decision about where the vaccine goes, but added, "We work very closely with the states and have been emphasizing the priority population

<TITLE> SC stays order on 130 Uttara plots </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 08 (bdnews24.com)  The Appellate Division on Sunday stayed a High Court order on city developer Rajuk to reserve 130 plots of Uttara Model Town's Phase III project before holding lottery for allocating of land there. Appellate Division chamber judge Mohammed Mozzammel Hossain gave a seven-day stay on a petition by the government. The High Court on Nov 4 ordered Rajuk to distribute plots in the third phase of the Uttara project only after setting aside 130 plots, whose allocation had been cancelled during the past caretaker government. Around 300 Uttara third phase plots were distributed on Oct 6, 2006. Of these, 130 allocations were cancelled by the caretaker government on allegations of irregularities. Applicants were invited again for the plots on Nov 26 last year. The High Court order was made on a petition filed at the beginning of this year by the 130 individuals who lost the plots. Meanwhile, Rajuk on the same day, Nov 4, had already allotted 273 plots by lottery in Uttara's Phase III project and in the new satellite town of Purbachal. The Uttara lottery saw 218 plots go to freedom fighters, artists, writers, sportspersons, private service holders, lawyers and forex earners, among others. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam was assisted in Sunday's hearing by deputies Mohammed Sohrawardy and Motahar Hossain Shaju. Deputy attorney general Mohammed Sohrawardy told reporters of the stay order at the end of the hearing. bdne

<TITLE> Chandpur embankment 'falling into Meghna' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chandpur, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  River erosion has attacked Chandpur city embankment near Molehead, at the extreme west of the town. Thousands of blocks of a 700 sq km area of the embankment have reportedly fallen into the Meghna river. Local Water Development Board officials arrived on the scene Sunday. Chandpur district commissioner Biswas Md Azimuddin also municipality mayor Nasiruddin Ahmed also visited the site on Sunday. Primarily, sandbags were thrown around the endangered area, but without much effect against the currents of the Meghna, said locals. Panic has seized the families living in the area. Monwara Begum, Kulsum Begum and Bachchu Mian, among the residents in the endangered area, told bdnews24.com that the blocks of the embankment adjacent to the Jamuna Pilot House had begun to plunge into the river from 7am Sunday. Many of their neighbours had left their houses in fear, they said. Blocks worth Tk 22 crore were most recently relaid along the embankment at Molehead in 2007. Numerous establishments including Chandpur railway station, 'Machghat' (fishing wharf), the river terminal and an ice-factory, which had been situated just about 200 yards from the newly endangered area, were swallowed by the river during rapid erosion on September 19, 2001. People living there are still haunted by the memory of the destruction. BIWTA senior assistant director Zahiruk Alam Khan said Sunday night, "The situation has calmed down a bit." "Orders have been served to WDB officials to continuously monitor the situation there." "We have been throwing down sand-bags. If needed, blocks will be laid there on an emergency basis too." bdnews2

<TITLE> Myanmar's Suu Kyi optimistic after US visit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 YANGON, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's detained opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, expressed hope on Monday that US engagement with the county's military rulers could spur democratic reforms, her lawyer said. In rare praise for the regime that has kept her in detention for 14 of the last 20 years, Suu Kyi thanked the junta for allowing her to see Kurt Campbell, the top U.S. official for East Asia. The Nobel Peace Prize winner was allowed to meet for almost three hours on Monday with her lawyers, who agreed to submit an appeal with the Supreme Court against her conviction in August for a security breach while under house arrest. "She told us she was quite satisfied with Mr. Campbell's visit ... She said he's the sort of person we can work with," lawyer Nyan Win told reporters. "She also expressed her thanks to the regime for their assistance during Campbell's visit." The two-day visit by the U.S. delegation was the first of its kind in 14 years and came as part of Washington's new policy of direct engagement with the generals. Campbell, deputy secretary of state, met Suu Kyi and senior government ministers during his two-day visit but was snubbed by Senior General Than Shwe, the junta supremo. On his return from Myanmar on Thursday, Deputy Assistant Secretary Scot Marciel said the main aim of the visit had been to encourage dialogue within Myanmar, between the junta, ethnic groups and opposition parties. He made few comments about next year's widely dismissed elections but said it would be "very hard" for the polls to be credible without the involvement of Suu Kyi. Analysts said the policy shift was as much about U.S. fears over China's influence in the region as the democratic process in Myanmar. Suu Kyi, who was sentenced to a further 18 months in detention for allowing an American intruder to stay at her Yangon home for two days, was allowed by the junta to meet Westerm envoys last month to discuss sanctions on the country. Marciel said it was neither "appropriate nor wise" to lift sanctions at this point even though they had failed, but said the embargoes would be reviewed if the country showed progress in initiating democratic reform. The former British colony has been ruled by various military juntas since a 1962 coup. The result of an election in 1990, won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party, was ignored by the generals, who jailed hundreds of opponents and tightened their grip on power. Critics say the military has learned from the 1990 polls and has no plans to relinquish power. They say the junta wants to make the process appear legitimate and credible and has drafted a constitution that will ensure it still calls the shots.

 WELLINGTON, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand Cricket (NZC) officials hope to appoint a new national coach by the end of the the year. Former coach Andy Moles quit last month after falling out with senior players and the team are playing their current limited over series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates without a coach. NZC chief executive Justin Vaughan said he expected a new coach would be named by the end of next month to allow him to prepare the team for their home series against Bangladesh, starting in February. "There's no rush. It's important that we make the right appointment," Vaughan said in a statement on Sunday. "We have begun a scoping exercise to clearly define the exact requirements for the position. "This is an essential first step which needs to be completed before any meaningful conversations can be held with potential candidates." Vaughan said he had been approached by a number of people interested in the position but was still uncertain the process he would use to pick the new coach. "The position will not be openly advertised, and we shall actively identify potential candidates we want to talk to," he said. "I can confirm I have received a number of strong inquiries from both New Zealand and overseas." Former coach Steve Rixon had already indicated he may be interested in the job, while local media have reported that former New Zealand opening batsman and India coach John Wright was also interested.

<TITLE> Man makes living by selling the shirt on his back </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!) - A T-shirt a day has kept unemployment at bay for an American man who is making about $85,000 a year by selling advertising space on his torso. Jason Sadler, 26, a former marketing professional from Florida, founded his own company, www.iwearyourshirt.com, in 2008 with the idea to wear a T-shirt supplied by any company and then use social media tools to promote the firm. For his human billboard service, Sadler charges the "face value" of the day so January 1 costs $1, while December 31 costs $365. Sadler said this may not sound like a lot but it adds up to $66,795 a year if he sells out every day, which he did this year. He also sells monthly sponsorships for $1,500, adding another $18,000 to his income. "I walk around, take photos, wear the shirt all day ... I blog about those photos, I put 'em up on Twitter, I change my Facebook profile ... and then I do a Youtube video," he told Reuters Television. "I made about $83,000 this year." The average US wage is about $615 a week or about $32,000 a year, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Sadler has already begun filling his 2010 calendar so, in true entrepreneurial fashion, he is expanding services by hiring another individual to wear a shirt a day on the west coast of the United States -- and is doubling his pri

<TITLE> US Gen. Casey: more troops needed for Afghanistan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - General George Casey, Army chief of staff, on Sunday became the latest US military official to advocate sending more troops to Afghanistan as President Barack Obama nears a decision on a new strategy. General Stanley McChrystal, the commander of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan, has recommended a 40,000-troop increase, but Casey would not comment on how many additional troops were needed. "I believe that we need to put additional forces into Afghanistan to give General McChrystal the ability to both dampen the successes of the Taliban while we train the Afghan civilian forces," Casey said on NBC's "Meet the Press." Obama is wrapping up deliberations on war strategy and is considering Pentagon options that include sending about 30,000 more troops, officials said on Saturday. A decision to send more troops to Afghanistan could become a political liability for Obama with public support eroding for the war. Military leaders have said the repeated long combat deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan have put a strain on the US armed forces. "The Army remains out of balance. But we started in 2007 with a program to get ourselves back in balance by 2011. And since 2007, we have added 40,000 soldiers to the active force, which is a significant step forward," Casey said on CNN's "State of the Uni

<TITLE> Panel suggests separate railway ministry </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnew24.com)--A parliamentary watchdog committee has suggested carving out an independent ministry for Bangladesh Railway to revamp the state operator. The committee on communications ministry says that former governments cared less about the railway and let it run into losses as customer service was abysmal. "An independent ministry would make it easier to help the railway to be commercially successful. The customer service will also improve," the committee chief, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, said after a meeting on Sunday. The railway is currently operating under the communications ministry. An independent ministry will allow railway development plans to go straight to the planning ministry for approval. An administrative reform project of the railway financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is currently held up. The project advisor proposed making the railway an independent ministry or an independent division under the communications ministry. However, the proposal has yet to be cleared by the communications ministry. Railway officials say they are not being able to properly implement development plans under the current framework. The continental railway started it journey 142 years back under the British rule. Bangladesh Railway, formed after independence, covers a total distance of1,855km and employs 34,168 people. Operations were run under the Railway Board until 1982, when it was brought under a department of the communications ministry. A nine-member committee was formed in 1995 with the communications minister as its chairman to oversee railway operations. bdnew

 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh and Bhutan have agreed to "explore the possibility of land connectivity" between the two countries under SAARC framework to enhance trade and people-to-people contact. The agreement came on Monday at the end of prime minister Sheikh Hasina's four-day visit to the Himalayan nation. Hasina announced waiver of tariff on 18 import items from Bhutan to increase the volume of trade, according to a joint press statement, released by foreign ministry, on the prime minister's visit. Bangladesh's exports to Bhutan is less than $1 million, and includes warm garments, computer accessories, dry food, pharmaceuticals, toiletries and textile items. Bhutan's exports to Bangladesh totals around $14 million, according to the latter's commerce ministry figures. Bhutan's main export items are mineral products, foodstuffs, fruits, beverages and oat. The two countries have also reached a consensus on "exploring the possibility of cooperation" in the energy sector under South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation charter. "Both sides emphasised the relevance of enhancing people to people contact to further strengthen the existing close ties of friendship and cooperation.

<TEXT>
 ROME, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mauro Camoranesi struck twice in two minutes to set second-placed Juventus on their way to a thrilling 5-2 win at Serie A strugglers Atalanta on Saturday. The Italy midfielder glided between the back-line to head his side ahead in the 36th minute and then thumped in a loose ball for his third goal in two games after scoring in Tuesday's 1-0 victory at Maccabi Haifa in the Champions League. Jaime Valdes pulled one back after the break for the Bergamo side trained by Antonio Conte, a contender for the job in Turin in the close season before his old Juve team mate Ciro Ferrara was promoted from caretaker to permanent coach. Brazil midfielder Felipe Melo restored the visitors' cushion with a pile-driver into the corner from well outside the box. Atalanta's Fabio Ceravolo exposed the defensive fragility behind Juve's recent inconsistency in Serie A in the 71st, stepping inside his marker before curling the ball inside the far post. But Diego and David Trezeguet were on target in the closing stages to wrap up a victory that gives them 24 points from 12 games, four points adrift of Inter Milan, who entertain AS Roma on Sunday. Earlier Napoli's impressive form under new coach Walter Mazzarri appeared to fizzle out when they were held 0-0 at second-from-bottom Catania. Napoli, who now share fifth place with Fiorentina, showed none of the fury that had enabled them to come from behind to beat Juventus 3-2 last weekend, their third win in four games after Mazzarri replaced Roberto Donadoni. The Sicilians were more enterprising and Japanese forward Takayuki Morimoto missed a glorious opportunity before the break when he blasted at the keeper from short range with the goal ga

<TITLE> G20 makes little progress on climate financing </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ST ANDREWS, Scotland, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rich countries and developing nations fought over climate change on Saturday, failing to make progress on financing ahead of a major environmental summit in Copenhagen next month. Britain, which was hosting a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Scotland, was determined to push toward a $100 billion deal to cover the costs of climate change by 2020. But talks got bogged down in a row with large developing countries about who should foot the bill. "There was a heated argument," Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said. "I think we should be very careful in approaching the possibility of piling big new commitments onto developing countries as this can put a brake on the pursuing of other crucial tasks such as the eradication of poverty." The climate change discussion had dragged on for hours and a French official said the debate was so intense there was a risk the final statement would not mention climate change at all. In the end, they agreed on the need "to increase significantly and urgently the scale and predictability of finance to implement an ambitious international agreement". European Union leaders agreed in October that developing countries would need 100 billion euros a year by 2020 to battle climate change. About 22-50 billion euros of the total will come from the public purse in rich countries worldwide and the EU is expected to provide between 20 and 30 percent of that. "It's a bit disappointing because we would have liked to have done a little bit more work," said French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde, adding that Europe's offer was "substantial". STUMBLING BLOCK China is often denounced by Western critics as the main obstacle to agreement, because it argues developing countries should not submit to binding international caps on emissions while they grow out of poverty. In turn, China and other emerging powers have said the rich countries have done far too little in vowing to cut their own greenhouse gas output, and in offering technology and money to the Third World to help cope with global warming. "We have not come as far as we had hoped even this morning," said German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. "We have not reached an agreement. There is still some work to do. I hope everybody knows that Copenhagen must not be a failure." A European source said there was also frustration in a sunny St Andrews at the stance of the United States, who were sitting on the fence over climate change financing. A 175-nation UN meeting in Barcelona ended on Friday with little progress towards a global deal on climate change but narrowed options on helping the poor to adapt to climate change, sharing technology and cutting emissions from deforestation. The final UN preparatory meeting before Copenhangen re-opened a rich-poor divide on sharing the burden of curbs on greenhouse gas emissions and criticism of the United States for not tabling a formal, carbon-cutting offer. About 40 world leaders will go to Copenhagen next month to improve the chances of clinching a climate deal, the United Nations has said. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, addressing the G20 delegates, said climate change was a test of global cooperation every bit as stern as the world financial cris

<TITLE> Aussie media hails ODI series victory </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com) -- Australian media on Monday hailed their national cricket team for the ODI series win against "upstart rivals" India in their own backyard, saying the triumph has established that Ricky Ponting's men are the undisputed kings of limited overs game, reports PTI. Australia took an unassailable 4-2 lead in the seven-match series after their six-wicket victory in Guwahati on Sunday, and the media here lauded Ricky Ponting's men for the way they tamed India despite being ravaged by injury to some of their top players before and during the tour. The series win also dashed India's ambition of dethroning Australia from the top position in the International Cricket Council ODI rankings. "Courageous Australia remain cricket's one-day kings after crushing upstart rivals India in a ruthless show of strength," screamed a write-up in the Courier Mail. "India's bold ambition to send Ricky Ponting's men home without the number one ranking proved hollow with Australia's six-wicket victory sealing the series and one-day bragging rights," it said. Headlined 'Jubilant Aussies take series over India', Herald Sun newspaper said the series win by Ponting's men would be more devastating to Indian psyche as it had come with a "virtual Australia-A side". "Dhoni's side will be licking its wounds for a while after being bashed by a virtual Australia 'A' side, short of front-line names but big on heart," it said. "The loss of Brett Lee, Peter Siddle, Tim Paine, James Hopes and Moises Henriques only served to galvanise Ponting's unit. Australia has depth in young talent who will not only hold the line as reinforcements but win battles of their own," the article in the Herald Sun said. "Ponting's injury-hit squad of 'home brand' warriors put India back in their box, dealing a huge psychological blow to their psyche," it added. The Age lauded Ponting's men for keeping Australia's 13-year undefeated ODI series run in India intact. "Australia will fly out this week with both its number one ranking and 13-year unbeaten run in one-day series here intact, after taking an unassailable 4-2 lead over India," the newspaper said. "Forty-five minutes of lethal new-ball bowling from Doug Bollinger and Mitchell Johnson paved the way for the six-wicket win at the Nehru Stadium at Guwahati," it a

<TITLE> Haye hoping for 'mega-showdown' with Vitali Klitschko </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Haye is hoping for a "mega-showdown" with Ukraine's WBC heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko after stripping Russian giant Nikolai Valuev of the WBA belt. The Briton, who overcame a colossal weight and height disadvantage to outpoint the towering "Beast from the East" in Germany on Saturday, must next fight the WBA's mandatory American challenger John Ruiz. Klitschko, whose brother Vladimir holds the IBF, IBO and WBO heavyweight belts, is scheduled to take on American Kevin Johnson in Berne, Switzerland, on Dec 12. "I am ready to fight anyone in the world and I have right now the same belt as Muhammad Ali, Lennox Lewis, Evander Holyfield and George Foreman," Klitschko told BBC radio on Sunday. "I am ready to show everyone that I am the strongest in the world," he added. "I am ready at any time to give him (Haye) a fight and knock him out." Haye, who spoke of his desire to "clean up the division" after stunning the tallest and heaviest world champion of all time in Nuremberg, said he was up to the challenge. "Let's get it on, let's make it happen," said the 29-year-old Londoner, Britain's first heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis retired six years ago. "He's got a fight in Dec, I hope he wins his fight and wish him luck with that one. I've got to get John Ruiz out of the way and then we can make a mega-showdown next year. I'm looking forward to that." HURT HAND Haye had been due to fight Vladimir Klitschko earlier in the year but the bout fell through due to the Briton being injured. He had also been planning to fight Vitali in September until the Valuev fight was made. "Ruiz is the mandatory challenger for the WBA so if I don't fight him they'll take the title off me so I don't fancy giving up the title after winning it," said Haye. "So it will be John Ruiz (next) and hopefully that will be in the UK. I definitely want to have another homecoming fight ... it would be amazing if I could fight John Ruiz in London. "We haven't thought about dates, I've got to see how my hand heals. I've got to go and get an X-ray and see the extent of the break and take it from there." Haye said after Saturday's fight that he feared he had broken his hand in the early rounds while Ruiz, who fought the same night, suffered a bad cut over his eye and is also likely to be out of action for a while. Haye's performance, after all the trash-talking in the build-up, drew plaudits at home. "I thought he had the talent and the speed and ability to beat the guy," said retired heavyweight Frank Bruno. "It took a lot of guts to come from cruiserweight to move up to heavyweight and fight a man mountain like he did. And he stuck to his guns." "King David Slays Russian Giant," boomed the Mail on Sunday in a headline. "Hayelelujah!" exclaimed the News of the World. Haye said it was a lifelong ambition fulfilled. "I said to anyone that would listen that I'd be heavyweight champion of the world. I am that now, so I've got a big grin on my face," he declared after a night partying with family and fri

<TITLE> United arrive at good time for Chelsea, Ancelotti says </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 COBHAM, England, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea face title rivals Manchester United at the perfect time on Sunday because the London side are fit, playing well and full of confidence, coach Carlo Ancelotti said. Chelsea, two points ahead of the champions at the top of the table, have scored 19 goals and conceded only two in their last five games, both of those by Sergio Aguero -- a possible Chelsea transfer target -- in Wednesday's 2-2 Champions League draw at Atletico Madrid. The club received a boost on Friday with news that they had been cleared to sign new players in the January transfer window after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) suspended a ban imposed by world body FIFA who found them guilty of inducing young Lens striker Gael Kakuta to break his contract. But Ancelotti hinted after Friday's training that the club would only spend if his squad suffered significant injury. After trotting out the usual clichs that the Manchester United match involved only three points like any other, Ancelotti said: "We are happy to play this game at this moment because we are playing very well, we are in good condition and we have a very good mental attitude just now." Chelsea have only one player injured, defender Jose Bosingwa. Ancelotti said the decision about whether the Portugal back would need an operation on a knee injury would be made in the next few days. The Italian coach, who has experience of both winning and losing against Ferguson's United while at AC Milan, said United could also be confident: "United have a very good team. Like us they are doing well because they have qualified in the Champions League and are doing well in the Premiership. "But everybody is vulnerable and there are no invincible teams," he added. United have not won at Stamford Bridge since 2002. Ancelotti said now was not the time to be thinking about signing players despite the CAS appeal decision. "We have this possibility now but we have time. We don't want to make a decision at this moment. I am very happy about this squad, these players," he said. Chelsea will lose several leading players, including in-form striker Didier Drogba and midfielders Michael Essien and John Obi Mikel for several weeks in January because of the African Nations Cup. "But if we maintain players all fit I think we can manage a good period also without the African players," Ancelotti said. Chelsea's scouts have been busy in recent weeks, however, and the club has been linked strongly in the British media with Aguero. The Italian added that United were not Chelsea's only realistic rivals for the title. Liverpool, he suggested, were probably out of the race but Arsenal looked dangerous, he

<TITLE> Dhaka, Thimphu agree land, energy links </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh and Bhutan have agreed to explore land links and energy ties under the SAARC framework. The two countries agreed to "explore the possibility of land connectivity" to enhance trade and people-to-people contact, according to a joint press statement released by foreign ministry on the prime minister's visit. The two countries have also reached a consensus on "exploring the possibility of cooperation" in the energy sector under South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation charter. The agreement came on Monday at the end of prime minister Sheikh Hasina's four-day visit to the Himalayan nation. The two sides signed a trade deal on Saturday. As a move to increase bilateral trade, Bhutan waived all duties on imports from Bangladesh. Hasina announced Dhaka's reduction of the existing 15 percent tariff to zero on 18 import items from Bhutan to increase the volume of trade, said the statement. Bangladesh's exports to Bhutan total less than $1 million, and include warm garments, computer accessories, dry foods, pharmaceuticals, toiletries and textile items. Bhutan's exports to Bangladesh totals around $14 million, according to the latter's commerce ministry figures. Bhutan's main export items are mineral products, foodstuffs, fruits, beverages and oats. "Both sides emphasised the relevance of enhancing people to people contact to further strengthen the existing close ties of friendship and cooperation," said the joint statement. They agreed to promote each other's tourism in their respective countries. "They also agreed to explore the possibility of land connectivity between Bhutan and Bangladesh under the aegis of SAARC transport connectivity to promote intra-regional trade and travel." The 14th SAARC summit in April 2007 in Delhi had special focus on regional connectivity. According to the regional connectivity plan, SAARC proposed a number of routes to integrate the South Asian countries. The major corridors proposed were: Lahore-Delhi-Kolkata-Petrapole-Benapole-Dhaka-Akhaura-Agartala (2,453 km), Kathmandu-Nepalganj-Delhi-Lahore-Karachi (2,643 km), Kathmandu-Birgunj-Kolkata-Haldia (1,323 km), and Thimpu-Phuentsholing-Jaigon-Kolkata-Haldia (1,039 km). Referring to the growing energy demand in Bangladesh and Bhutan's high potential for production of hydro electricity, the two sides also agreed to explore possibility of cooperation in the field of energy under the SAARC regional cooperation in energy sector. Mountainous Bhutan has the potential to produce about 30,000 MW of electricity, according to SAARC estimate. The Indian companies have so far been able to exploit 10,000 MW of electricity most of which goes to India. Bangladesh and Bhutan will have to construct a 50-km long distribution lines to import its power subject to approval of India's central government. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina went to Bhutan on Nov 6 on an invitation from Bhutanese premier Lyonchen Jigmi Thinley, and returned home Monday afternoon. During her stay in the Himalayan country, Hasina was also received by the King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and his father Jigme Singye Wangchuck. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, commerce minister Faruk Khan and industries minister Dilip Barua accompanied the prime minister.

<TITLE> Colombia turns to UN, OAS after Venezuela war talk </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BOGOTA Nov 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Colombia said on Sunday it will appeal to the UN Security Council and the OAS after Hugo Chavez, the fiery leftist president of neighboring Venezuela, ordered his army to prepare for war in order to assure peace. For months Chavez has said that a military cooperation pact signed last month between Bogota and Washington could set the stage for a US invasion of Venezuela from Colombian territory. The United States and Colombia dismiss that idea, saying cooperation is aimed strictly at fighting drug traffickers and Marxist insurgents within Colombia. During a Sunday television address, Chavez ordered his military to prepare for war as the best way to preserve peace in the region. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe shot back with a statement rejecting Chavez's remarks. "Considering the threats of war enunciated by the government of Venezuela, the government of Colombia proposes going to the Organization of American States and the Security Council of the United Nations," the statement said. Colombia also called for "frank dialogue" with Venezuela over their long-simmering diplomatic spat. Venezuela has spent more than $3 billion on arms, prompting US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to warn against an arms race in the region. Colombia recently asked the World Trade Organization to intercede after Chavez blocked the import of some Colombian goods in protest of the US military pact. After the United States, the neighboring Andean countries are each other's second biggest trade partners. Commerce last year between Colombia and Venezuela was more than $7 billion. Colombia says the blocking of imports has exacerbated the country's recession and hurt an export sector already clobbered by low global demand brought by the world financial crisis. Washington sees Uribe as a buffer against Chavez and other socialists in the region such as Rafael Correa of Ecuador, a country that also shares a border with Colombia. The three leaders have all moved to extend their time in power through Constitutional changes allowing for re-elect

 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)The British Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce is looking to bring millions to Bangladesh, if the government can provide a suitable investment climate. A 15-member BBCC delegation, on a four-day trip to the country, sees "huge potential" for business and investment in Bangladesh. "Most of our delegates are British citizens of Bangladeshi origin," chamber president Shahagir Bakht Faruk told a press conference in the city on Sunday, jointly organised by BBCC and the British High Commission's UK Trade and Investment department. "Therefore, they all have a special feeling about the home country. We are trying to find ways to build more trade and commerce between Britain and Bangladesh." The delegation arrived in Dhaka Saturday on a mission to explore sectors suitable for investment in Bangladesh and products that would interest the British market. UKTI (Bangladesh) director Kevin Ringham said, "We are hoping that Bangladesh will get investments of more than $100 million through this initiative." But, he said, the amount of money was not the main focus right now. "Rather this initiative will start a new relationship, that will boost future cooperation in the field of business and investment. The businessmen said they were looking at shipping, hospitality, fashion, medical facilities, consultancy, education and housing. "We want Bangladeshi citizens to enjoy British services, technology, medical facilities, education and many other things. At the same time, we want to create scope for exporting new products," said Faruk. The BBCC are already invested in a number of projects in Bangladesh. bdn

<TITLE> Federer beaten by Djokovic in home final </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BASEL, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number one Roger Federer missed out on a fourth successive Swiss Indoors title when he lost to third-ranked Novak Djokovic in the final of his hometown tournament on Sunday. The Serbian won 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 to record his third win over Federer in five meetings this year and notch his fourth ATP title of the year after winning in Beijing, Belgrade and Dubai. The Swiss, who was once a ball boy at the tournament, was returning after a six-week mini-break following his US Open final defeat to Juan Martin del Potro. Federer, who had not previously dropped a set or lost a service game in the tournament, had his serve broken four times as he lost a final for the third time this year following defeats at the Australian and US Open. The match featured an extraordinary 10th game in the first set where Federer saved six set points and Djokovic five break points before the Serbian wrapped up the set at the seventh attempt. "I tried to stop him from taking control of the match because when he does, he's the best in the world and he can end the match very quickly," Djokovic told reporters. "I tried to be patient, have good tactics and put pressure on him and make him play an extra shot." Federer said: "No doubt, it's disappointing to lose in the final at home." "I missed plenty of opportunities, I was always down in the score. Each time I swung the momentum my way, I got broken again. If I had played a bit better on the attack, then it could have made a difference. It was a close match." MISPLACED PASS Both players rattled off their first four service games easily before Federer was broken in the ninth. The 10th game took 24 minutes as both players made mistakes at crucial moments. Federer sent a flurry of shots into the net while Djokovic repeatedly overhit his drives when presented with the chance to wrap up the set. Federer eventually obliged for him with a misplaced pass as he faced set point for the seventh time. The Swiss started the second set by having his serve broken again before enjoying his best spell of the match. He broke back in the fourth game with an exquisite drop shot from the baseline, which brought the house down, and again in the 10th to wrap up the second set, helped by a double fault from Djokovic. Federer lost serve twice in a row at the start of the third set and frittered away his last chance when he squandered three break points in succession in the sixth game. Djokovic finished off the match at the first attempt when Federer sent an attempted drive high into the a

<TITLE> Akhtar leaves for Pakistan after knee surgery </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com) -- Controversial Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has left for home on Sunday after undergoing a successful knee surgery in London, reports PTI. Akhtar, who went under knife for an injury on left knee last month, decided to fly for home as he was very keen to represent his departmental side KRL in remaining matches of the premier domestic tournament Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, a source said. The surgery was supervised by Dr Andrew Williams, who also treated England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff, at the Wellington hospital in London. However, the Pakistan Cricket Board has refused to foot his medical expenses and operation contending although Akhtar was a centrally contracted player, he had not sustained the injury while on national duty. "Shoaib's rehabilitation process from the operation has gone extremely well and he is recovering fast," the source said. "Shoaib has been told by the doctors that if he takes care of himself he can play for at least another two to three years without any problem from the knee and bowl at his full pace. This has made him very optimistic about his future," the source added. Akhtar, who has struggled with fitness and disciplinary issues, was eyeing a return to the national squad for the tour of Australia later this year. "Australia is one place he loves to play and it is one cricket playing nation where he wants to leave a lasting impression with his performance," the source said. After a rehabilitation process in Lahore, the pacer would start bowling in nets and then try to play for KRL in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy. The national selectors have already said that to make a comeback to the Pakistan squad, Akhtar has to prove his fitness by performing in the domestic cir

<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has strongly protested and expressed deep concern at the unprovoked shooting and killing of a Bangladeshi child by India's Border Security Force. A protest note, handed to the Indian High Commission in Dhaka, states that such shooting incidents are in clear violation of the Bangladesh-India Border Guidelines of 1975, the foreign ministry said on Sunday. A twelve year old Bangladeshi girl was shot and killed by Indian border guards of 162 BSF Sahapara Camp at around 6pm on Nov 6, the ministry said in a statement. The body of the child was found about 25 yards inside Bangladesh territory near Border Pillar No 1066 at Roumari in Kurigram district. Bangladesh has also conveyed concern at the trend of indiscriminate shooting and killing by BSF, which creates unnecessary tensions between the two border security forces, said the foreign ministry. "Such acts go against the spirit of good neighbourliness and the close friendly relations that exist between Bangladesh and India," the protest note observed. Bangladesh has demanded that a proper investigation be conducted by the concerned authorities of India and necessary legal action be taken against those responsible. Bangladesh has also called for a strong policy directive to the Border Security Forces to put an end to such shootings

 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  Six people have so far died from infection of H1N1 virus (swine flu) in Bangladesh, the IEDCR said on Sunday. The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research confirmed three deaths until the first week of October. Three others died in the past one month. "Of the six dead, most of them live outside Dhaka. A laboratory test has confirmed that they were infected with H1N1 virus," Mahmudur Rahman, director of the IEDCR said. The number of H1N1 virus infected cases stood at 800 until Sunday, he said. The figure was 680 on Oct 11. Rahman said: "We do not fear the spread of swine flu in our country though it has turned serious in the developed countries. "The intensity of winter is not that helpful in transmission of the virus. That's why the chance of infection is very little here. "It comes to our country from the developed nations," he said. On H1N1 vaccine Rahman said: "Many countries have already started using the vaccine. "We are delaying procurement of the vaccine of our own as we expect to receive it from World Health Organisaiton. But we don't know about how much vaccine we will be provided and when." The IEDCR director, however, hoped to get the vaccine at the start of the next year. The first case of swine flu was detected in Bangladesh on June 18. The government on Aug 31 confirmed the first H1N1 death in Bangladesh. WHO declared a global H1N1 flu pandemic on June 11. b

<TITLE> Ida becomes hurricane again in northwest Caribbean </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MEXICO CITY, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tropical Storm Ida became a Category 1 hurricane again late on Saturday in the northwestern Caribbean off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, the US National Hurricane Center said. The Miami-based hurricane center said Ida, which first became a hurricane on Thursday off the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua before weakening over that country, reached maximum sustained winds of about 75 miles per hour (120 kph), and was about 120 miles (195 km) east-southeast of Cozumel, Mexico. Tropical storms become hurricanes when top sustained winds reach 74 mph (119 kph). Forecasters expected the storm to weaken as it moves into the Gulf of Mexico next week. Skies were sunny and clear on Saturday in the Mexican resort of Cancun, and Ida is expected to pass east of the city on Sunday afternoon. Mexico issued a hurricane watch for the Yucatan Peninsula from the resort of Tulum to Cabo Catoche, north of Cancun. A tropical storm warning was in effect for Grand Cayman Island and for the western Cuban province of Pinar del Rio, the hurricane center said. The Mexican government urged people to avoid unnecessary travel in the Yucatan Peninsula and imposed restrictions on coastal shipping. Mexico's state oil monopoly, Pemex, which has extensive operations in the Gulf of Mexico, activated its hurricane contingency program but oil and gas production was unaffected, a company spokesman said. US energy companies said on Friday they were monitoring the storm's progress but had not yet begun evacuating any production platforms. The Gulf of Mexico accounts for a quarter of US domestic oil production and 15 percent of natural gas output. The Gulf Coast is also home to 40 percent of the nation's refining capacity. Ida dumped heavy rain along Nicaragua's Caribbean coast earlier in the week, but there were no reports of fatalities. The country's coffee crop was not directly affected by the storm, according to the local coffee counc

<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)--Action will be taken against military officers if any links are found with the bomb attack on MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh , the home minister said on Monday following media reports. "The matter is under investigation. Whoever is linked with the event will have to get punishment," Sahara Khatun said in reply to a media query after a meeting with visiting UNCTAD executive director Mike Smith. A number of media reported that several military officers were involved with the bomb attack on Taposh, one of the lawyers of the state panel in the Bangabandhu murder appeals hearing. Sahara said there were allegations against military officers for their links with the killings of political leaders since the assassination of founding father 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. "The tendency has started since 1975. They (the military officers) will not dare to proceed further once the Bangabandhu murder trial is complete." The minister said the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development executive director, also assistant secretary general of the United Nations, had proposed for setting up a Counter Terrorism Institute in Bangladesh. The government is determined to wipe out militancy. If the institute is built not only Bangladesh but also the member countries of SAARC will benefit from it in controlling and curbing militancy, she said. bd

<TITLE> Dalai Lama begins visit to Arunachal Pradesh </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TAWANG, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of Buddhist monks and supporters welcomed Tibet's exiled spiritual leader on Sunday to Arunachal Pradesh also claimed by China, a trip that has renewed tensions between the Asian giants. The Dalai Lama arrived by helicopter in this remote Buddhist enclave nestled in the icy folds of the eastern Himalayas, where he had passed through after fleeing Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule. The visit, as well as reports of border incursions in recent months, has triggered tensions between the world's two most populous nations, whose relations remain hostage to mutual suspicion lingering from a brief 1962 border war. Beijing has criticised the visit as undermining Chinese territorial integrity. It has slammed the Dalai Lama's "scheme to wreck China's relations" with India. The Tibetan leader says the week long visit is merely a spiritual lecture tour. China lays claim to 90,000 sq km of land on the eastern sector of the border. India disputes that and instead says China occupies 38,000 sq km (15,000 sq miles) of territory in Aksai Chin plateau in the western Himalayas. Hundreds of people lined the road to Tawang -- a moonscape of steep, craggy mountains and white stupas, which is home to the Monpa people who practice Tibetan Buddhism and speak a tongue similar to Tibetan. Roads were washed, welcome gates with colourful Buddhist paintings erected and the valley's main monastery decked up. With hundreds of exiled Tibetans arriving for the event from all over India, the town took on a carnival look to greet the Dalai Lama. "He is our god," said a young woman who gave her name as Choeden in between helping put up Tibetan scripture-bearing holy flags. "He has come back to bless us all. China may or may not recognise him but that is not important for us. Can the Chinese remove him from our hearts?" Lamas or monks swathed in maroon and saffron robes chanted sutras, blew gongs and swung incense sticks before a 25-ft high golden Buddha at the main monastery - a pagoda-like structure with brilliant red, blue and white paintings. ANGER The Tawang monastery is said to be the biggest after the Potala Palace in Lhasa. Outside, many locals expressed rage with China. "The Chinese government is pure evil and it knows what the Dalai Lama means to us," said Pema Tsering, who runs a local grocery store. "They call him names to belittle him. But he is like the ocean, a few drops of poison doesn't spoil it." Beijing calls the Dalai Lama a dangerous "splittist" plotting Tibetan independence, a charge he denies. He says he is merely seeking autonomy for Tibet. Tawang is the birthplace of the sixth Dalai Lama and part of territory Beijing considers as "southern" Tibet, and is at the heart of the border row with India. India and China, which compete for global resources and influence, have also exchanged diplomatic barbs at multi-lateral forums and sparred over visa policies for their citizens in an escalating row that many fear could spiral out of control. This, despite relations thawing in recent years on the back of mutual trade that is expected to exceed $60 billion next year, a 30-fold increase since 20

<TITLE> Pedro inspires Barca to 4-2 win over Mallorca </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pedro netted twice and Thierry Henry scored his first of the season to set leaders Barcelona on the way to a 4-2 win over Real Mallorca in La Liga on Saturday and put them four points clear of second-placed Real Madrid. Pep Guardiola fielded an unfamiliar starting lineup at the Nou Camp after consecutive draws against Osasuna and Rubin Kazan, leaving Spain midfielders Xavi and Andres Iniesta on the bench along with Argentina forward Lionel Messi. The ploy seemed to be paying off when Zlatan Ibrahimovic showed off his sublime talent to release Pedro to slot home Barca's first in the 11th minute but they were rocked back nine minutes later when Jose Carlos Nunes headed in from a corner. Mallorca goalkeeper Dudu Aouate was unlucky to concede a second five minutes before halftime after he produced three superb saves during a desperate goalmouth scramble to deny Pedro, Henry and Sergio Busquets. But Pedro eventually smashed the ball into the net from close range. Pedro was again involved in Barca's third four minutes later, floating a freekick to the far post that Busquets nodded back across goal for Henry, who recently returned from a thigh strain, to head into the empty net. Messi replaced Pedro in the 51st minute and stroked home a late penalty after Ibrahimovic was chopped down in the area before Alhassane Keita scored a consolation in added time. Barca have 26 points from 10 matches, four ahead of Real Madrid, who are again without the injured Cristiano Ronaldo when they play at city rivals Atletico in Saturday's late match. NINE-MAN DEPOR Deportivo Coruna made light of having a player sent off in each half earlier on Saturday to win 2-0 at Getafe and climb above Valencia into fourth. Mista nodded the visitors in front in the 15th minute before Miguel Angel Lotina's side went down to 10 men 12 minutes later. Striker Riki was shown a second yellow card for what appeared from television replays to be an attempted handball after he was earlier booked for diving in the penalty area. The referee sent an angry Lotina off the bench shortly after for the coach's repeated protests but Depor managed to double their lead on the hour when Mista presented defender Filipe with a simple tap in. Midfielder Sergio was dismissed with 17 minutes of regular time left for a second yellow but Depor kept Getafe at bay and are level on 19 points with third-placed Sevilla and one ahead of Valencia in fifth. Sevilla host improving Villarreal on Sunday and Valencia entertain promoted Real Zaragoza. Also on Saturday, Malaga fought back from two goals down to draw 2-2 at promoted Tenerife and moved one place off the bottom, above Xerez, who play at Real Valladolid on Sunday, on goal differ
